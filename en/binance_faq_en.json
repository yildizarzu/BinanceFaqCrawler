        "answer": "Binance Lite Referral is enhancing its Trading Fee Rebate Voucher rewards program for the next two months. To take part, simply invite your friends to register on Binance using your Lite Referral ID/Link and ensure that they complete Identity Verification and the deposit tasks. Both you and your friends will be eligible to receive a minimum of 200 USDT or up to 1,000 USDT Trading Fee Rebate Voucher as a reward. \n The promotion period starts 2023-06-28 07:00 (UTC) and ends 2023-08-27 23:59 (UTC). \n There are 3 face values available: 200 USDT, 500 USDT, and 1000 USDT.  \n Please note that higher face value vouchers are relatively rare compared to lower face value ones. During the promotional period, each user can only reveal the voucher once to get a personalized amount that will be effective.  \n To receive the upgraded reward, click the [Click to Reveal] button on the Lite Referral Page before sharing your Lite Referral ID/Link during the promotion period. This will ensure that the upgraded reward amount will be valid for the entire promotion period.  \n If you share your Lite Referral Link/ID without revealing the upgraded face value of your Trading Fee Rebate Voucher, both you and your referral will only be eligible for the original 100 USDT Trading Fee Rebate Voucher reward upon your referral’s completion of the deposit task. \n This campaign offers you the opportunity to get two different Trading Fee Rebate Vouchers. \n As an inviter, you will receive the revealed benefits once your referred friends complete the deposit task.  \n As an invitee, you will obtain the benefits shared by your inviter upon completing the deposit task. \n For example: \n User B uncovers a personalized reward worth 1,000 USDT in Trading Fee Rebate Voucher. User A is an invitee of user B, user A and B will each receive a Trading Fee Rebate Voucher worth 1,000 USDT after user A completes registration, Identity Verification, and deposit tasks.  \n User A uncovers a personalized Trading Fee Rebate Voucher worth 500 USDT. After user A shares their Lite referral Link/ID with friends, user A and friends will each receive a Trading Fee Rebate Voucher of 500 USDT, after user A’s friends complete the requirements listed above. \n You can check the effective time, face value, and expiration time on the Lite Referral Page.  \n Before sharing your Lite Referral ID/Link with your friends, you must click on the [Click to Reveal] button on the Lite Referral Landing page to unlock your personalized Trading Fee Rebate Voucher. \n If you dont reveal your personalized Trading Fee Rebate Voucher, both you and your friends will only be able to receive a standard 100 USDT Trading Fee Rebate Voucher. \n No, each new user can only be referred via one referral mode. If a new user registers a Binance account using the Lite Referral ID/Link, the referrer won’t be eligible for commission-based rewards from the Standard Referral Mode. \n Any deposit made through a third-party payment method or from another Binance account will not count toward the referrals deposit task requirement. Deposits via a sub-account or account transfer will not meet the deposit requirement. \n In addition, both referrers and referrals will be subjected to risk analysis and may not be considered if they don’t comply with  Binance’s risk policy. \n The inviter and invitee must complete Identity Verification within seven days after the Trading Fee Rebate Voucher becomes available to be able to distribute the rewards.  \n The reward will be automatically distributed to your [Rewards Hub] within 48 hours after  successful Identity Verification. But they have to claim their rewards within seven days after they get it.  \n Its important to know that both referrers and referrals will be subjected to risk analysis. If they dont comply with Binance’s risk policy, they may not get the reward. \n All rewards will be issued as Trading Fee Rebate Vouchers, which can be used for Spot trading on Binance. To redeem your voucher, please go to the [Reward Hub]. The Trading Fee Rebate Voucher will be valid for a period of 14 days starting from the date of activation.  \n Once the voucher is activated, any rebates earned from trading fees will be credited to your Spot account in USDT before 23:59:59 the following day. \n For more details on how to use Trading Fee Rebate Vouchers, please refer to Trading Fee Rebate Voucher Terms and Conditions. \n "

Dashboard \n Here you can view your total earnings (equivalent in BTC), the number of referrals and traded referrals, and the top-ranking referrers and their bonus. \n 2. Referrals \n You can keep track of your referrals’ data, including their UID, the number of trades, and the referral bonus you earned from their trades.  \n 3. Commission Rebate \n You can view the commission earned from each of your referrals. \n The Referral Dashboard Pro is an enhanced version of the Standard Referral Dashboard. It helps you track and manage your referral data. \n You can access the Referral Dashboard Pro by clicking [Go to Pro] at the top right of the Standard Referral dashboard.  \n For more details, please refer to How to Use the Binance Affiliate Referral Dashboard Pro. \n By default, you won’t receive any commission for your referrals’ Futures trades. If Futures trading is not restricted in your region, you can activate your Futures account and you will start earning a 10% commission from your referrals. They will also get a 10% discount on Futures trading fees for the first 30 days.  \n If you wish to promote Futures trading, please submit your application here. Your Futures referral commission will be upgraded to 30% after the Binance Affiliates team reviews and approves your application. \n Note:  \n Your existing referral links will continue to work and you can receive the new 41% commission rate. However, we recommend creating a new custom link if you wish to share more than a 10% commission rebate with your referrals.  \n You can only share a maximum of 10% rebate with your referrals using the 20% commission link, but you can share up to a maximum of 20% rebate with a 41% commission link.  \n You will only receive commissions from your referrals trades on Spot, Margin, Futures, and Binance Pool. As Binance offers different products for crypto trading, you wont receive a commission if your referral uses other trading methods.   \n We recommend assisting your referrals to switch to ‘Pro Mode’ if they are using the Binance App and buy using the Spot Exchange. In addition, you can assist your users with new user tutorials on how to use Spot Exchange via Desktop. \n There are different ways to promote your referral links. Here are some examples: \n a. Embed your referral ID to Binance.com links \n When sharing links from Binance.com, you can embed your referral ID at the end of the URL by adding “?ref=XXXXXXX (your referral ID)”. For example, your referral ID is 12345678. You can embed it to a link like this: “https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BNB_BUSD?ref=12345678”. When a new user registers a Binance account via your referral link, your referral ID will be automatically filled in and you can earn commission from them.  \n b. Mention the trading fee discount you’re offering when you share your referral links \n You can create custom links with different discount percentages for your referrals. After creating the links, don’t forget to tell your audience the trading fee discount you are offering to encourage them to register.  \n c. Share your referral links on your platforms and content \n You can share your referral links with more people to gain more referrals. For example: \n "

You also won’t be on your own, as one of our seasoned crypto content experts will be guiding you throughout the journey. Each class helps you discover essential skills and tools to succeed in the crypto-creator economy. \n Some classes will feature a hands-on project that lets you practice with a real audience. You can also win rewards by completing the classes and projects, such as bonus incentives, extra commission, and up to $3,000 in BUSD. For additional information, please check out our blog. \n This Bootcamp is currently available to all existing Binance users outside of the restricted regions. Please note that this Bootcamp is only available in select languages. If you’re interested in becoming the next crypto influencer, sign up from the Bootcamp landing page within the sign-up period. Sign-ups outside of this period will not be eligible to participate in the current Bootcamp and will be put on the waiting list for our next Bootcamp. You can check the registration status or sign-up for the waiting list here. \n 1. How do I access the Bootcamp class videos? \n After the sign-up period, users who successfully signed up will receive class one via the email linked to their Binance account. After that, youll receive the rest of the class videos and project instructions daily for a total of eight days. \n 2. What will I learn from this Bootcamp? \n This e-course contains seven classes. Please see each class topic below.   \n 3. What are the class projects? \n Each class has its own project where you will have to complete tasks related to the class. Class projects are designed to help you get the most out of your learning experience and enhance your understanding of the entire Binance ecosystem. Users who complete all class projects are eligible to receive up to $3,000 in BUSD.  \n 3.1 When will I receive an update on my project status? \n Please allow up to a week for your project to finish the evaluation process after your submission. Project email updates go out every Friday at 11:00 UTC. Please note that if you submit a project after Wednesday 11: 00 UTC, you may not receive an update until the following Friday. Project updates will be sent out via email and notification messages within the Binance App. \n 3.2  When will I get my reward? \n All rewards are distributed by the 15th of each month by 11:00 UTC. \n 3.3 Why did I not pass more projects or get a larger reward? \n Please note that all projects were graded carefully based on the following factors: \n There is no project for classes 1 and 7. \n Class Two Project. \n You must create original content on one of the listed topics and have a total trading volume worth the equivalent of 10 BTC or more. In this Bootcamp, trading volume is considered the total amount of traded assets of your referrals in a month. If you don’t reach the BTC trading volume, then you may not be eligible for a monetary reward for this project. \n Class Three Project. \n You must create and submit original content that has at least 5,000 views. Fake views will not be accepted. If you pass this project, but don’t pass class project number 5, then you may not be eligible for a monetary reward for this project. \n Class Four Project. \n You must create 3 pieces of original short-form content with at least 1,000 total views for each piece. Fake views will not be accepted. If you pass this project, but don’t pass class project number 6, then you may not be eligible for a monetary reward for this project. \n Class Five Project. \n You must get 8 new KYC registrations within one month. Registrations must be from legitimate users, and batch registrations will not be accepted. Know your customer (KYC) refers to the identity verification process. It’s a common regulatory requirement for financial service providers that helps protect users and aims to combat illicit funding and money laundering. \n Class Six Project. \n Turn at least 5 of your KYC registrations to active users over a one-month period with a trading volume worth at least 4 BTC. An active user is someone who makes a deposit or trades spot, futures, or margin. Participants who use market/trader manipulation or don’t have any users who make deposits will not be eligible for a  monetary reward. For example, giving your referrals crypto to trade or having friends sign-up to make the exact same trades are considered trading manipulation under the Bootcamp Program rules. \n 3.4 Do my referrals have to complete Identity Verification for their Binance accounts for project 5? \n Yes, you should encourage your referrals to complete Identity Verification. If none of your referrals verify their Binance account, you may not be eligible to receive any BUSD reward for this project.  \n 4. Is there a deadline for completing the class projects? \n Yes, participants must complete all class projects within one month of receiving the project submission email. For example, class one began on Mar 28, 2022, and the deadline to submit your projects will be April 28, 2022. \n Please note that projects are accepted and evaluated on a rolling basis. If you need additional time to complete your project, simply submit your project when you are absolutely ready. You do not need special permission to submit your project past the one-month deadline. Please note that your project will also be evaluated within one month of submission.  \n 5. I passed the Bootcamp. What happens next?  \n Participants who pass the Bootcamp are eligible to become a Binance Affiliate and have the opportunity to experience the program as a Bootcamp graduate.  \n As a graduate, you are eligible to receive monthly BUSD performance rewards, fixed long-term rewards based on your performance, specialized graduate campaigns, and exclusive Binance swag. \n 6. Do I have to complete all the class projects? \n No, it is not mandatory to complete all class projects. However, the more projects you complete, the larger your reward amount. We encourage you to try to complete all five projects.  \n 7. Are there any rewards for completing class projects? \n Yes, participants who complete one class project will be eligible to join the Binance Affiliate Program and receive all the benefits of being an affiliate. You can also get up to $3,000 in BUSD for completing all projects and additional ongoing rewards for being a Bootcamp graduate. \n As a Binance Affiliate, you’re entitled to more commission (up to 50% for Spot trading). You’ll also get a sign-up bonus package for your community and an incentive-filled content program.  \n 8. What is the exclusivity pathway? \n To access all seven class videos, you must agree to promote Binance for a three-month period. If you do not want to go through the exclusivity pathway, you will only have access to classes one, two, and four with fewer reward options. Moreover, the maximum reward will only be 500 BUSD. \n 9. How do I submit a project?  \n You will receive an email with the submission form after the last class video, or you can submit it here. \n You can select which classes you would like to submit projects for. Please note that you must submit the published content links when submitting the projects for classes two, three, and four.   \n 10. Some projects require content submissions, can I submit the same content for multiple projects? \n No, each class project requires original content. The same content cannot be submitted for multiple projects.  \n 11. Do I have to complete the class projects in order? \n No, once you have watched all the class videos, you can complete the class projects as you see fit.  \n 12. How can I see my total registrations for class five? \n Go to the referral dashboard, select [Standard Referral], and click [Referrals]. \n 13. How do I know if I passed a class project? \n After the project submission deadline, the projects you uploaded will be evaluated. You’ll receive the results and the total reward amount via email. \n 14. How do I achieve the minimum BTC trading volume? \n We will calculate the trading volume in BTC from users you invited to Binance. This includes the trading volume in all Binance trading markets. \n 15. What are the minimum requirements for receiving the project rewards?  \n To be eligible to receive the reward for any class project, you must pass each of their minimum requirements. Please note that to pass the Bootcamp, you only need to pass the minimum requirements for one project. However, metrics such as the total number of followers, new referrals, and active referrals are taken into consideration during the evaluation process. If you pass project number 3 or project number 4, but your Binance referral account is inactive, then you may not be eligible to receive a reward for those class projects. \n  \n "

Is there a cap on how much commission that I can make? \n There is no commission cap for the commission based rewards. However, there is a cap on the Fiat and P2P content reward model. The budget will be re-evaluated and adjusted based on overall performance. The February budget is set to 48K for Fiat and 3K for P2P,  and will be distributed on a first come, first served basis.  \n 12. When will I receive my rewards? \n After you submit your content, we will notify you by the 15th of the following month. The bonus will be credited to your Spot Wallet.

        "answer_tittle": "How does Binance evaluate listed tokens?",
        "answer": "To protect our users and ensure that listed tokens and trading pairs continue to meet the high level of standards we expect, Binance conducts periodic reviews of each listed token and spot/margin trading pair on our platform based on the guidelines stipulated below.  \n When a listed token or spot/margin trading pair no longer meets these standards, Binance will conduct a more in-depth review, and potentially delist the token or spot/margin trading pair to protect users’ interests. \n Binance regularly communicates with the project teams of listed tokens to understand their latest developments, such as their product roadmap, team changes, and more. This includes both positive and negative changes (e.g., unexpected deviations from the project team’s original plans). \n During major market events, Binance will also check in with these project teams to understand how they have been impacted. If a project team encounters an incident (e.g., the project was hacked), Binance will also reach out to see if any support is required. After the incident, Binance will conduct a review of how the project team handled the incident, and whether the project team has introduced proper measures to prevent similar incidents from happening. \n In addition, we always welcome and value users feedback and suggestions at Binance. Besides the above reviews, we will conduct investigations and evaluate whether a listed token meets our standards if there is a large number of complaints for a listed token.  \n To protect users and maintain a high quality trading market, Binance conducts periodic reviews of all listed spot/margin trading pairs, and may delist selected spot/margin trading pairs due to multiple factors, such as poor liquidity and trading volume.  \n Please note that the delisting of a spot/margin trading pair does not affect the availability of the tokens on Binance Spot/Margin, where applicable. You can still trade the spot/margin trading pair’s base and quote assets on other trading pair(s) that are available on Binance.  \n Binance considers a variety of factors when conducting delisting reviews. Here are some examples: \n When a token is delisted on Binance, you may withdraw the delisted token to your external wallets before the cessation of withdrawals, as specified in the delisting announcement. The cessation of withdrawals generally takes place three months after the corresponding token’s delisting date and time. \n Please note: Delisted tokens may be converted into stablecoins on behalf of users after Binance has ceased withdrawals for the corresponding delisted tokens, and the proceeds will be credited to users’ Binance accounts. Before delisted tokens are converted into stablecoins, a separate notification will be made. \n Due to its sensitivity, Binance does not disclose any delisting decisions to external parties. However, we regularly contact the project teams of listed tokens to collect information on their latest developments, such as their product roadmap, team changes, and more.  \n Project teams should actively build their products, engage with their communities frequently, and publish a clear product roadmap. \n It will depend on the project’s traction. \n Delisting a token will result in the removal of the token from all Binance products and services, which includes all applicable spot/margin trading pairs.  \n On the other hand, delisting a spot/margin trading pair does not affect the availability of the tokens on Binance Spot/Margin. You can still trade the spot/margin trading pair’s base and quote assets on other trading pair(s) that are available on Binance.  \n Disclaimer: A list of the Supported Digital Assets is published on our Website. According to Binance Terms of Use, we may remove or suspend one or more Digital Assets from the list of Supported Digital Assets and we will use reasonable commercial efforts to notify you in advance. Meaning that you will no longer be able to access such Digital Assets as part of the Binance Services and will only be permitted to withdraw the Digital Assets from your Binance Account. \n Risk Warning: Digital asset prices are subject to high market risk and price volatility. The value of your investment may go down or up, and you may not get back the amount invested. You are solely responsible for your investment decisions and Binance is not liable for any losses you may incur. Past performance is not a reliable predictor of future performance. You should only invest in products you are familiar with and where you understand the risks. You should carefully consider your investment experience, financial situation, investment objectives and risk tolerance and consult an independent financial adviser prior to making any investment. This material should not be construed as financial advice. For more information, see our Terms of Use and Risk Warning. \n "

        "answer": "You can now access Venus Protocol from the Binance App directly. After connecting your Binance DeFi Wallet, you can easily transfer funds from your Binance Spot Wallet to Venus Protocol and start earning interest.  \n Venus Protocol is a decentralized lending platform on the BNB Chain. It leverages audited smart contracts to provide crypto loan services. You can supply and borrow popular cryptocurrencies on the platform to earn interest.  \n 1. Log in to your Binance App. On the homepage, drag down to access the [Marketplace].  \n Please make sure your App is updated to the latest version. \n 2.  Select [Venus Protocol] and tap [Connect] to connect your Binance DeFi Wallet. You can create a new wallet or import an existing wallet by your seed phrase. \n 3. You can now transfer funds from your Spot Wallet to your DeFi Wallet. Select the asset to transfer and tap [Next].  \n Please note that you will need some BNB in your DeFi Wallet to pay for gas fees on Venus Protocol. We suggest maintaining a balance of $25 in BNB to cover your transactions. \n 4. Enter the amount to transfer and tap [Withdrawal].  \n 5. After transferring your funds, you can access the Venus Protocol features. On the [Market] tab, you can check each asset’s total supply, APY, liquidity, total borrowed funds, and collateral factor. \n An asset’s collateral factor determines the proportion of its value that can be borrowed against. For example, if you supplied $1,000 of BNB with a collateral factor of 80%, your maximum borrow limit is $800. If you reach 100% of your available credit ($1,000), you might be liquidated. Therefore, we recommend you only use a maximum of 40% of your available credit limit if you’re using highly volatile assets as collateral.  \n 1. Go to [Supply] and select an asset. In this example, we will use TUSD. \n 2. To supply assets, you need to enable the collateral first. Tap [Enable].  \n 3. You will see a pop-up asking for permission to access your funds. Tap [Approve].  \n 4. Enter the amount you wish to supply. Check the details and tap [Supply].  \n 5. Once the transactions have been confirmed, your assets will be supplied directly from your DeFi Wallet into Venus Protocol, and you will immediately start earning interest. \n Please note that interest will be automatically deposited to your supplied asset balance. You will not see any incoming transactions on your Binance Spot Wallet. \n 1. Go to [Borrow] and select an asset. In this example, we will use TUSD. \n 2. To borrow assets, you need to enable your supplied assets to be used as collateral. Toggle on the button to enable. \n 3. You will see a pop-up asking for confirmation. Tap [Confirm]. \n 4. You can now enter the amount to borrow. Check the details and tap [Borrow].  \n 5. Once the transactions have been confirmed, the borrowed assets will be deposited directly to your Venus Protocol account, and interest will start to incur immediately.  \n Please note that interest will incur on your borrowed asset balance. You will not see any incoming transactions on your Binance Spot Wallet. \n 1. Go to [Borrow] and select the asset you borrowed. Tap on the [Repay] tab. \n 2. Tap [Enable] and you will see a pop-up asking for permission to access your funds. Tap [Confirm].  \n 3. Enter the amount to repay and tap [Repay]. \n When you supply assets to Venus Protocol, you are also accumulating XVS Rewards in addition to algorithmically adjusted compounding rates.  \n To view and claim your XVS tokens, tap [Account] - [Claim]. \n "

Once the subscription period is over, each user’s token allocation will be roughly calculated as:  \n 1. Visit our Binance Fan Token Platform, sign up for an account, and complete your identity verification process. Our Beginner’s Guide will help you get started. \n 2. Explore new Binance Fan Token listings under the “Featured Teams” area. Select the team token you’re interested in and that will directly take you to the corresponding Binance Fan Token’s Launchpad page. \n 3. Calculate your participation limit. This is determined by your average BNB balance over a set period of days. You do not need to do anything additional with your BNB during this period. \n 4. Commit BNB. Once your participation limit is determined, you will be able to commit and lock any amount of BNB up to your participation limit to receive Binance Fan Tokens. \n 5. Calculation. Once the BNB commitment period is over, we will calculate each user’s token allocation for around 1 hour. \n 6. Finally, BNB is deducted for Binance Fan Tokens. Once each user’s final allocation is determined, a portion of your locked BNB will be deducted in exchange for tokens. Both your BNB and Binance Fan Tokens will be automatically transferred to your Spot Wallet. \n For additional information, read our Binance Launchpad Subscription Format frequently asked questions.  \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is the NFT PowerStation?",
        "answer": "Tutorial Video \n NFT PowerStation is an innovative Binance Fan Token feature and the best way to step up your game as a devoted fan to score rewards using the supported NFTs on the Binance Fan Token Platform. NFT PowerStation allows you to charge your supported NFTs to power up your fandom and claim extra Binance Fan Tokens rewards for supporting your team of choice. \n Binance Fan Token rewards will be distributed from a predetermined pool of tokens. They will be allocated depending on various factors, including: the type of supported NFTs charged, the Fan Power each charging NFT represents, and the number of participants. The longer you charge your NFTs, the higher your fan rewards will be. Please note that rewards are calculated on an hourly basis. \n 1. Sign up for a Binance account and complete Identity Verification. Our Beginner’s Guide will help you get started. \n 2. Get the supported NFTs to participate in the NFT PowerStation. Find your favorite teams on the Binance NFT Marketplace and purchase the supported NFTs or Mystery Boxes using your Binance Fan Tokens. You can get Binance Fan Tokens via Launchpool or Launchpad at the public sale or after they are listed on Binance via credit or debit card, Spot, or P2P trading.   \n 3. Visit the Binance Fan Token Platform to discover active PowerStations. Visit your preferred team profile under featured teams and switch to the “PowerStation” tab or find the latest PowerStation activities by scrolling down on the platform landing page. \n 4. Warm up for the activity and add your NFTs to the PowerStation slots. During the warm-up period, you can select and charge your previously acquired NFTs to the PowerStation slots. Remember, various NFT editions and NFT rarity tiers represent different levels of Fan Power. You cannot charge NFTs if they are already charging in another slot, being withdrawn, or on sale in the NFT Marketplace.  \n 5. Track PowerStation performance before and during each activity. You can track the following details of a PowerStation activity from warm-up until the end of each activity: \n  \n 6. Maximize your Fan Power with Full Set charging. To activate a Full Set of NFTs, allowing you to double your Fan Power and potential rewards, you need to charge all different items representing different categories of an NFT series. The easiest way to check if you have a full set is to visit the My Collections tab under the team profiles. \n 7. Claim hourly rewards and track your PowerStation progress. You can accumulate rewards every hour and claim them directly to your Spot Wallet at any time. Under [Reward History] - [Calculation History], you can check all your previously accumulated rewards, or go to [Distribution History] to see all claimed rewards to date. \n 8. Get in or get out of the NFT PowerStation any time. You can remove NFTs from the PowerStation immediately and abandon the activity at any point. However, the longer you participate, the more share you can get from the total reward pool. Once an NFT PowerStation activity is finished, all your previously charged NFTs will be unlocked, and all your unclaimed rewards will be automatically transferred to your Spot Wallet. \n NFTs have various classifications ranging from N (Normal), R (Rare), SR (Super Rare), and SSR (Super Super Rare). You can see it denoted in the corner of each NFT. The rarer the NFT, the more Fan Power it represents and the more rewards you can collect by charging it. \n 1. What is a Full Set and how to double your Fan Power for twice the rewards? \n To activate a Full Set, allowing you to double your Fan Power and apply a 2x multiplier on your token rewards, you need to charge all different categories representing different items of an NFT series. The easiest way to check if you have a full set is to visit the [My Collections] tab under team profiles, where you will also be able to see additional items you need to acquire a Full Set. \n 2. Can I remove my NFTs after they have been charged in the PowerStation? \n Yes, you can remove your NFTs from the PowerStation at any point without any delay. However, please note that the rewards will differ depending on the rarity and the number of NFTs charged in the pool. When you remove your NFTs, the rewards will be prorated according to the time (in hours) you charged. \n 3. Is there a limit to the number of NFTs I can charge? \n Yes, the current limit will be based on the number of types of NFTs in the base collection. \n 4. Which Binance Fan Token NFTs will support PowerStation charging? \n Look out for the latest on new Binance Fan Token launches and activities here! \n PowerStation Glossary \n Please Note: \n "

The easiest way to purchase your tokens is by crediting your account with fiat via credit and debit card or a linked bank account.

P2P is a marketplace for buyers and sellers to broadcast their offers and exchange directly on their own terms—using various payment methods and fiat currencies—regardless of their country of origin. Some other benefits of P2P are: \n 1. Before you start, log into your Binance account and complete Identity Verification. Then enable 2FA (two-factor authentication), such as Google Authentication under [Profile] - [Security]. \n 2. Visit the Binance Fan Token Platform and explore Binance Fan Tokens and team listings.  \n 3. Scroll down and click the [Buy] button, then select the [P2P] option from the list.   \n  \n Alternatively, you can also access P2P from the [P2P] under the [Buy Crypto] tab on the top navigation bar.  \n 4.

Click the [Search] button. \n 5. Click the [Buy] button next to your preferred listing and review the order details and the seller’s payment information. Select a payment method and copy the payee information to make a payment as instructed.  \n  \n 6. The transaction between you and the seller will be facilitated by the Binance platform in a way that the seller’s crypto will be locked away until the order is completed, so you can transfer funds worry-free. Double-check the payee information and complete the transaction within the time limit. \n 7. Once the transaction is made, click on [Transferred, Next] and then [Confirm]. The status will be updated to “To be released”, and the seller will release the crypto assets once they confirm that the payment is received. Then the transaction will be completed.

        "answer": "Binance Fan Tokens provide fans with more meaningful ways to engage with their favorite sports teams and brands. Fans can support teams by purchasing and holding team tokens and they can exchange these tokens to buy and sell special and limited edition NFT collectibles on the secondary marketplace. \n Binance NFT Marketplace is a community marketplace, built on the Binance blockchain infrastructure, featuring a variety of digital collectibles from artists, creators, and celebrities. Users can launch, exchange, and bid for NFTs and Mystery Boxes. \n A Mystery Box contains one special NFT that is only revealed when a user opens the box. Compared to expensive artworks and NFTs, every user can buy a Mystery Box at a relatively low price and take part in a raffle, where they have the chance to get limited edition NFTs.  Depending on their rarity, Mystery Boxes can be categorized into four types: ranging from normal (N), rare (R), super rare (SR) to super, super rare (SSR).  \n Here’s how you can get started: \n 1. Visit the Binance Fan Token Platform and log into your Binance account. Complete Identity Verification if you haven’t already. \n 2. Choose your favorite team from the ‘Featured Teams’ section. On the team page, scroll down and you will find the ‘NFT Mystery Box’ section below the voting polls. Alternatively, visit the Mystery Box Market in the Binance NFT Marketplace. \n 3. Under the NFT Mystery Box section, you’ll find information about the name and description, the remaining amount, price (expressed in Binance Fan Tokens), and expiration date of each Mystery Box. \n  \n 4. Click on the [Go to Marketplace] button and select the number of Mystery Boxes you wish to purchase, then click on [Buy Now]. \n 5. Confirm your order in the pop-up window and purchase additional Binance Fan Tokens if you need more to finalize your purchase. \n 6. After buying a Mystery Box, you can choose to open it or add it to your collection. Note that Mystery Boxes are non-refundable. However, you can sell the Mystery Box on the Marketplace or open it and sell the NFT that it contains. \n 1. Purchasing NFTs can be done in different ways on the Binance NFT Marketplace, depending on the listing. You can either buy an item in an instant sale or bid for it in an auction.  \n 2. For fixed-price or instant sale NFTs, you can simply click the [Buy Now] button to pay the full price and acquire your collectibles. \n 3. For the auction sale method, you will have to place bids within the auction timeframe to increase your chance of winning: the higher the bid, the bigger the chance you will secure an item. For auction-type NFTs, you will have to enter the bid amount in the pop-up window. The “minimum markup” refers to the amount you need to add to the previous bid to place your new bid. Click [Place a Bid] and make sure that you have enough Binance Fan Token in your account to confirm your bid.  \n 4. Note that once a bid is placed, it cannot be canceled and your funds will be locked until another user places a higher bid, or until the auction closes. \n Remember, you can always sell NFTs on the secondary marketplace. For your sale, you can choose between the Fixed Price and Auction methods and take payment in multiple crypto assets. \n Note that users will not be able to purchase NFTs on the secondary market using Binance Fan Token at the time of launch of the Binance Fan Token Platform. However, when placing a bid or trying to buy an NFT at a fixed price on the marketplace, users will have the chance to use certain stablecoins and crypto assets for their purchases. \n "

        "answer": "Binance Earn \n Binance Earn offers a suite of products for you to grow your crypto holdings easily.  \n Simple Earn, Launchpool, BNB Vault, and more opportunities are available on the platform. Binance will regularly launch high-quality products for Binance Earn, so make sure to check them out regularly. \n Log in to your Binance account and click [Finance] - [Earn] to view all the products. \n Currently, Binance Earn offers 2 types of earnings - Protected and High Yield. Users can choose to invest their crypto for predictable returns, or high-yield staking coins that provide higher than average gains but with corresponding risks to your invested principal. Please only invest what you can afford to risk, regardless of how high the potential rates of return are. \n If you are new to crypto, you can get started with the products listed under [Protected]. These products have relatively more stable yields, and you will get back your principal upon redemption or at the end of the locking period, where applicable. \n To search for crypto to invest, click on the drop-down menu to find your desired crypto, or click [Popular Coins] or [Best for Beginners] to see our suggested lists. Click [Search Coins] to search. \n Alternatively, if you are looking for specific Binance Earn products, hover your mouse to view all the available products, and click on the arrow button to enter the respective product pages. \n Simple Earn offers two types of products - Flexible Products and Locked Products. Similar to a banks demand deposit, you can deposit your crypto and gain daily interest from your dormant funds. \n Flexible Products allow you to redeem your assets whenever you need, while Locked Products require you to deposit your assets for a fixed period and in return, you earn a higher return than Flexible Products. Please note that if you withdraw your funds in advance from Locked Products, you will also lose the accrued rewards. \n When users stake their crypto assets in DeFi projects, such as by providing liquidity to a liquidity pool, they will get rewards. By reinvesting these rewards, users can start a process known as Yield Farming. \n Launchpool is the perfect option for users to farm new assets. You can acquire newly launched tokens as rewards when you stake BNB, TUSD, and other crypto assets. You can withdraw your deposited assets at any time, and rewards are distributed every hour. \n BNB Vault is a capital-guaranteed investment product to help you put your idle crypto to work. \n By investing in the Vault, BNB HODLers can easily invest in both centralized and decentralized finance products in just one easy step, with maximized yields and benefits from multiple opportunities available in the Binance ecosystem. \n 1.4 ETH Staking \n Binance launched the ETH Staking service to provide everyone with an accessible platform to stake their Ethereum. Get started in a few clicks with just 0.1 ETH, and Binance will cover all validator operating expenses and bear the risk of on-chain penalties, where applicable. All applicable on-chain staking rewards will be distributed to users. \n Besides “Protected” products, Binance offers users a series of high yield products with relatively higher risks. Please DYOR before getting started.  \n DeFi (Decentralized Finance) provides decentralized financial services through smart contracts on a blockchain. Binance introduced DeFi Staking to help proxy users participate in related decentralized projects. You can now access the world of DeFi easily on Binance, without having the need to manage private keys, acquire resources, make trades, or perform other complicated tasks required for DeFi Staking participation. Earn the highest possible returns in the most simple and safest way. \n Please note that DeFi products must be locked for a fixed period. If you need to withdraw your assets in advance, you may lose your corresponding rewards. Please read the product rules for more details before you participate. \n Dual Investment lets you deposit a single cryptocurrency and earn yield based on two assets. You can commit your crypto holdings and lock in a savings yield, but you will earn even more if the market price of their committed holdings increases. Dual Investment provides you with much more control over your risks. \n The return on your savings will depend on how the crypto market has moved since the day you invested your crypto into Binance Dual Investment. When the product expires, you may choose to settle with one of the assets from the two options (such as BTC or USDT). It offers non-guaranteed floating earnings, you can obtain the highest possible earnings while satisfying your digital asset risk management needs. \n On the expiry date, the final settlement currency is determined by comparing the settlement price and the strike price. If the market price on your crypto holdings increases and your earnings exceed the savings rate, you’ll get the higher amount. If the market price on your crypto holdings dips or your earnings is below the savings rate, you’ll still get the yield from your savings. The bottom line is that your return will always be allocated to your benefit. \n However, please note that your order cannot be redeemed in advance. \n Binance Liquid Swap embraces the principles of liquidity pools. It combines the advantages of centralized and decentralized financial services, allowing users to obtain high annual returns by providing liquidity to liquidity pools on Binance. \n You can also swap cryptocurrencies in the liquidity pool and enjoy the benefits of low slippage and low handling fees, or remove assets at any time, but you will need to pay a handling fee if you swap only a single asset in the pool. \n Ready to start earning passive income?

        "answer": "Tutorial Video \n Simple Earn allows you to earn daily rewards by depositing your digital assets for flexible or locked terms. You can subscribe or redeem at almost any time, so you can retain flexibility and liquidity over your assets while earning daily rewards. For more details, please refer to the Terms & Conditions for each product. \n Locked Products provide higher rewards in exchange for your assets being committed for fixed terms with predetermined redemption dates. You can still choose to redeem your full balance at any time before the redemption date, but you will forgo any rewards you have accrued or received up to that point. \n Flexible Savings, Locked Savings, and Locked Staking have been replaced by Simple Earn. Simple Earn simplifies and enhances your subscription experience by integrating various options into a one-stop platform for you to earn daily rewards.  \n You can easily subscribe to flexible-term and locked-term products on a single platform. Rewards distribution, subscription, and redemption processes are now more streamlined and easier to use. For more details on how the different products work, please refer to: \n Please note that your existing Flexible Savings and Locked Staking positions have been automatically transitioned into Simple Earn Flexible and Locked Products respectively on 22 September 2022. You can manage all your existing positions from your Earn Wallet.  \n Daily rewards are distributed from Binance’s own funds and are determined based on the assessment and evaluation of prevailing market conditions.  \n The assets you deposit in Simple Earn are used for a variety of purposes, including by other business units within Binance. \n Assets may be used for on-chain staking in a tightly controlled manner. Binance may stake through official staking pools, or operate validators and nodes to participate in Proof-of-Stake (POS) network staking. The staking pool selection is determined via stringent risk assessment protocols. Validators and nodes operated by Binance are set up with security as the utmost priority.  \n Assets may also be used by other business units in Binance for operational purposes. However, business units must adhere to stringent policies and explicit limitations around utilizing user assets deposited in Simple Earn. This may include assets that are loaned to other Binance users (e.g. Margin and Crypto Loan products) and other operational demands. \n Binance may also run promotional campaigns from time to time that are sponsored by partnered projects in order to attract more users onto our platform. Thanks to our partners, Binance Earn may run short-term Simple Earn product offerings with higher APRs to benefit users. \n Simple Earn APR rewards are determined with various carefully designed factors to ensure that rewards paid to Simple Earn users are sustainable and competitive. Moreover, the APR offered to Simple Earn users is discretionary and doesnt reflect any indication of profitability within Binances various operations.  \n For example, Binance may have regard to its competitors offerings in deciding on appropriate levels of APR. Advertised rewards are not actual or predicted returns/yield in any fiat currency. \n Binance may also maintain a promotional rewards reserve to run promotional campaigns and introduce short-term promotional APR offerings on selected tokens from time to time. \n Simple Earn APR rewards offered to users are either Real-Time APR and Bonus Tiered APR rewards for Flexible Products or Locked Product APR for Locked Products.  \n Please refer to the Flexible and Locked Products FAQ to learn more about how these rewards are calculated. \n Disclaimer:  \n This document may have been translated and published in different languages.

        "answer": "You can subscribe to Binance Simple Earn Flexible Products at any time from the new Simple Earn platform and start earning rewards every minute.  \n Assets subscribed to Simple Earn Flexible Products can also be used as collateral for Binance Flexible Loan. These collateral assets will continue to earn Real-Time APR rewards, but not Bonus Tiered APR rewards or airdrops. Find out more about Binance Flexible Loans here. \n Binance Simple Earn Flexible Product assets can also be used in Binance Pay. You can send your Flexible Product assets to other Binance users via Binance Pay. Find out more about this new function here. *Binance Pay Terms and Conditions apply. \n When you subscribe to Simple Earn Flexible Products, you’re providing liquidity to business units within Binance for operational purposes, which include lending Simple Earn assets to other users via Margin and Loan products. Interest accrued from Margin and Loan products is converted into yield, which may be distributed to you as compensation for supplying your assets as liquidity. \n We aim to ensure that a portion of each liquidity pool remains accessible for redemptions by applying utilization limits on each token, and strive to maintain a balance in liquidity pools for token redemptions. Nonetheless, a large amount of redemption requests for a specific token might cause a temporary shortage in the available balances. In these instances, redemptions may resume upon borrowers repaying borrowed amounts or with additional liquidity provided by other users. Rest assured, your assets remain safe and secure.  \n We strive to ensure smooth transactions. Please be advised that while liquidity pool balances are available for redemptions, there is a possibility that users’ assets on Simple Earn may not be instantly redeemable due to real-time demand and supply dynamics. Binance will not be held liable for any losses resulting from delays in fulfilling redemption requests in Simple Earn Flexible Products that may arise from time to time. For more information, please consult our Simple Earn Terms.  \n Subscriptions are immediate; your assets will be transferred from your Spot Wallet into the product of your choice upon confirmation. \n Once you submit a redemption request, your Flexible Product assets will be processed for redemption and returned to your Spot Wallet immediately. You’ll continue to earn Real-Time APR rewards up to the minute of redemption, but any Bonus Tiered APR rewards accrued for that day will be forfeited.  \n Simple Earn Flexible Product assets that are pledged as collateral in Binance Flexible Loan will not be redeemable. You must first repay the loan these assets are pledged for and release them from collateralization before you can redeem them. \n Daily redemption limits apply to each Flexible Product and are subject to change at any time. The availability of redemptions or delays in fulfillment of redemption requests may be a result of various factors, including but not limited to the following: \n The Auto-Subscribe function helps you automatically subscribe to Simple Earn products using assets from your Spot Wallet.  \n You can enable Auto-Subscribe for Flexible Products from the Simple Earn homepage, on the subscription pop-up, or from your Earn Wallet. Simply toggle on the [Auto-Subscribe] button next to the product to enable the function. \n Please note: \n Rewards for Flexible Products consist of Real-Time APR Rewards and Bonus Tiered APR Rewards.  \n Real-Time APR is a live indication of rewards you can receive and is subject to change every minute. This APR applies to the total asset amount you deposit in each Flexible Product. Real-Time APR rewards are accrued and directly accumulated in your Earn Wallet every minute, rounded to 8 decimal places. As a result, your Flexible Product balance for each token will increase over time. Please note that you won’t see distribution records since these rewards are not distributed to your Spot Wallet. You may refer to your Simple Earn History for a daily record of Real-Time APR rewards earned. \n For example, if you subscribe with 2,000 ABC tokens with a current Real-Time APR of 2.09%, you’ll get 2,000ABC * 2.09%/365/24/60 = 0.00007952 ABC in the next minute. Your Flexible Product balance in the next minute will thus be 2,000.00007952 ABC. \n Binance may offer Bonus Tiered APR Rewards from time to time on selected Flexible Products through a tiered rate structure. ​​Binance may occasionally offer Bonus Tiered APR Rewards on selected Flexible Products via a tiered rate structure. The Bonus Tiered rewards structure offers different levels of APR according to the asset amount deposited into the selected Flexible Products. This APR is subject to change on a day-to-day basis. The published Bonus Tiered APR on our Website indicates the rewards you may receive throughout your subscription to Flexible Products. The daily rewards you receive are subject to changes in the daily published Bonus Tiered APR.  \n The Bonus Tiered APR rewards are accrued the day after subscription, starting at 00:00 UTC. You’ll begin receiving reward distributions in your Spot Wallet the day after accrual starts (two days after subscription) between 00:00 UTC and 08:00 UTC.  \n For example, if you subscribe with 2,000 ABC tokens on day 1 with a current Bonus Tiered APR of 5% on the first 500 ABC tokens, you’ll accrue interest starting from day 2 at 00:00 UTC. After accruing interest on the first day, you’ll receive 500 ABC * 5%/365 = 0.06849 ABC tokens on day 3. \n For more information about Simple Earn, please refer to the following guides:  \n Disclaimer: \n This document may have been translated and published in different languages.

        "answer": "Binance Simple Earn Locked Products provide higher rewards in exchange for your assets being committed for fixed terms with predetermined redemption dates. You can still choose to redeem your full balance at any time before the redemption date, but you will forgo any rewards you have received or accrued up to that point. \n Subscriptions are immediate, and your assets will be transferred from your Spot Wallet into the chosen Locked Product upon confirmation of your subscription. Redemptions for Simple Earn Locked Products are open daily between 00:10 to 23:50 (UTC+0).  \n Each Locked Product has its own product and individual subscription limits. Once the limits are reached, subscriptions will no longer be processed, including Auto-Subscribe requests. These limits are subject to change at any time. \n Locked Products will be automatically redeemed in full on the redemption date. Your assets will be subscribed to the Flexible Product of the same cryptocurrency in your Earn Wallet, along with the rewards accrued for the last day. Assets subscribed to Flexible Products will generate rewards every minute, and you can redeem them anytime. For more information, please refer to the detailed guide Get Started with Binance Simple Earn Flexible Products.  \n In case of early redemption, you will receive the full balance of your locked assets, minus any rewards you have received during the term, into your Spot Wallet within the next 72 hours. \n In the event of extreme market volatility, network delays, or when there is an unusually large number of redemption requests, your redemptions might be delayed. \n Typically, when you redeem your Locked Products before expiry, any distributed rewards will be deducted from your redemption proceeds. Binance may, at its absolute discretion, implement a 5% rebate on the distributed rewards for early redemptions. \n The 5% rebate (which would otherwise be fully forfeited) will be used to create a 90-day locked position, provided it meets the required minimum staking requirement: \n The Auto-Subscribe function helps you automatically renew your existing Locked Product position into a new locked term of the same duration upon expiry. Renewals will only consist of the original amount of your initial subscription, while rewards will continue to be sent to your Spot Wallet. \n If the available quota for any particular Locked Product is filled, your position may not be renewed even if Auto-Subscribe is enabled. Once your position expires, your assets will be subscribed to the Flexible Product of the same cryptocurrency in your Earn Wallet. Auto-Subscribe is only available for selected Locked Products and is subject to change any time. \n You can enable Auto-Subscribe for Locked Products on the subscription pop-up or from your Earn Wallet. Simply toggle on the [Auto-Subscribe] button next to the product to enable the function. \n Rewards = Deposited Assets * APR/365 (rounded down to 8 decimal places) \n Please note that APR is subject to change daily. The estimated rewards displayed at the beginning of your subscription may differ from the actual rewards generated.  \n Once you subscribe, your assets will start accruing rewards at 00:00 (UTC+0) the next day. After the first full day of accruing rewards, your first distribution will arrive at your Spot Wallet on the following day. You’ll not receive rewards on the day of the subscription. Rewards are calculated and distributed to your Spot Wallet daily between 00:00 and 08:00 (UTC+0). However, due to network delays, system calculations, and other unforeseeable reasons, reward distributions might be delayed. \n For certain Locked Products, the rewards distributed may be in different cryptocurrencies from the subscribed assets. For such cases, rewards will only be distributed with your subscribed assets upon the expiry of the fixed-term product.  \n For more information about Simple Earn, please refer to:  \n Disclaimer:  \n This document may have been translated and published in different languages.

        "answer_tittle": "What is Ethereum Proof of Stake?",
        "answer": "Ethereum switched to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm in 2022 to improve the network’s speed, efficiency, and scalability. Before this change was made, Ethereum used Proof-of-Work (PoW) and a mining mechanism to process transactions. In PoS, instead of mining, users can stake their coins in order to validate transactions and earn rewards.  \n After the Merge, Ethereums Mainnet is replaced with the Beacon Chain. On April 12, 2023, the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade (EIP-4895) added withdrawal functionality. \n  For more details, please refer to these Academy articles: \n If you want to become a validator on Ethereum, you are required to stake a minimum of 32 ETH. You will need to fulfill the minimum staking requirement, prepare the hardware equipment, and hold some additional assets to settle the node operation costs. You must also consider other risks, such as slashing and liquidity risks associated with unstaking queues. \n To address this, Binance launched the ETH Staking service to offer a more accessible way for everyone to participate in Ethereum staking. You can start with just 0.0001 ETH, and Binance will bear the risk of on-chain penalties.  \n Note: Starting from 6 July 2023, Binance applies a 10% fee on ETH staking rewards. The fee is applied prior to the staking reward distribution. This fee will help to offset operating costs, such as hardware and network maintenance costs related to setting up validator nodes. The remaining on-chain staking rewards will be fully distributed to users. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and click [Earn] - [Staking] - [ETH Staking]. \n 2. Click [Stake Now]. \n 3. Enter the amount you want to stake and you will see the BETH amount you can get. Read and agree to the terms and click [Confirm]. \n 4. A second confirmation window will pop up. Read and confirm the terms and conditions by checking the boxes. Click [Confirm]. \n 5. You have successfully staked your ETH. You can view your staked assets and reward details on the ETH Staking page. \n During the staking period, BETH rewards will be distributed daily based on your BETH holdings. The ETH redemption amount will be based on your current BETH holdings instead of your initial staked assets. For example, if you stake 100 ETH, you can get 100 BETH at a 1:1 ratio. On the redemption date, if you hold 110 BETH, you can redeem 110 ETH. Binance will cover all validator operating expenses for users on ETH Staking. For more details about the ETH rewards distribution, please refer to the FAQ section on the ETH Staking page. \n If you hold BETH, the staking rewards will be distributed in the form of BETH to your Spot Wallet daily from T + 2 day. For example, if you choose to stake your ETH today (T - day), your BETH rewards will start accruing the next day (T + 1 day), and the staking rewards of T - day amount will be distributed on the next day after accruing (T + 2 day). \n Tutorial Video \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and go to [ETH Staking]. Next, click the [Redeem] button.  \n 2. Enter the amount of ETH you would like to redeem from your BETH balance, and click the [Redeem] button.  \n Please note that the expected ETH distribution date is indicated on the page and users can’t cancel their ETH redemption requests after submission. \n 3. The redeemed ETH will be returned to your Spot Wallet when your ETH withdrawal request is fully processed.  \n Note:  \n BETH withdrawal outside of the Binance platform is not supported. If you would like to withdraw the staked ETH from Binance for other purposes or participate in DeFi applications while still entitled to the ETH Staking rewards, you may consider wrapping your BETH into WBETH. \n This document may have been translated and published in different languages. In the event of any inconsistency, misstatements, omissions, or errors appearing in any translated version, the English version shall prevail. \n Disclaimer: Digital asset prices can be volatile. The value of your investment may go down or up and you may not get back the amount invested. You are solely responsible for your investment decisions and Binance is not liable for any losses you may incur. For selected staking products, Binance takes on all slashing risk. This means that the same amount of Digital Assets staked will be returned to you, even if they are slashed. Not financial advice. For more information, see our Terms of Use and Risk Warning. \n "

        "answer": "Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH) is a new liquid staking token, where 1 WBETH represents 1 BETH. It also represents the staking rewards accrued by BETH token on ETH Staking after 2023-04-27 08:00 (UTC). You can use WBETH to participate in DeFi projects outside Binance and still receive the corresponding ETH Staking rewards accrued.  \n You can wrap your BETH tokens to WBETH or unwrap your WBETH to BETH tokens on the ETH Staking page at zero fees. While the initial conversion rate between BETH and WBETH is 1:1 starting 2023-04-27 08:00 (UTC), this may change over time in accordance with the daily APR for ETH Staking. \n You will receive ETH Staking rewards from the Ethereum Network in the form of BETH, based on the BETH holdings in your Spot Wallet.  \n The ETH Staking rewards will be distributed daily.  \n  \n Each WBETH token you hold will accrue ETH Staking rewards from the Ethereum Network daily, based on the daily APR of the service. \n To redeem your ETH Staking rewards in the form of BETH, you can unwrap your WBETH tokens. \n However, please note that you will not receive WBETH tokens as staking rewards. \n Also, the BETH you receive will depend on the daily BETH/WBETH conversion rate. \n More flexibility to access DeFi protocols and services outside Binance while still remaining eligible to earn ETH Staking rewards through your WBETH holdings. \n  \n  \n 1.

A second confirmation window will pop up. Read the terms and conditions and check the boxes. Click [Confirm]. \n 5. You’ve successfully wrapped your BETH. You can view your wrapped asset balance and conversion rate on the WBETH page.  \n You can also view your transaction history by clicking [Wrap/Unwrap Record]. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and go to [Earn] - [ETH Staking] - [Wrap BETH]. Go to the [Unwrap] tab.  \n 2. Enter the amount of WBETH you want to unwrap from your balance, and click [Unwrap]. \n 3. The unwrapped BETH will be returned to your Spot Wallet. \n  \n You can mint WBETH on DeFi platforms like PancakeSwap, or using on-chain smart contracts on BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum. With WBETH, you can use it to interact with various DeFi platforms, such as PancakeSwap (Ethereum and BSC), Curve, Balancer, and Maverick.  \n 1. Lending and borrowing protocols \n You can deposit WBETH into lending platforms to earn yields, or use it as collateral to borrow other assets to enhance capital efficiency. Example: VENUS. \n 2. Liquidity farming \n You can also farm yields with WBETH by forming liquidity pool tokens. Examples: PancakeSwap (Ethereum and BSC), Curve, Balancer, and Maverick (Ethereum and BSC). \n 3. Structured products and yield aggregators \n You may also subscribe to structured products and yield aggregation services. Example: Pendle. \n 4. Is WBETH worth more than ETH? \n WBETH carries the value of 1 BETH and the staking rewards it accrues. While the value of BETH and ETH is pegged at a 1:1 ratio, the value of WBETH versus ETH and BETH continues to increase, reflecting the staking rewards locked within Ethereum. You can check the real-time conversion rate from the WBETH product page. \n 5. Is WBETH safe? \n WBETH is safe because you can unwrap it back to BETH anytime with zero fees on the WBETH product page. However, please do your own research before participating in any DeFi project. \n Risk Warning: Digital asset prices can be volatile. The value of your investment may go down or up and you may not get back the amount invested. You are solely responsible for your investment decisions and Binance is not liable for any losses you may incur.

        "answer": "Binance Pool is a comprehensive service platform dedicated to improving the income of miners. Binance Pool provides mining services to users with a focus on PoW and PoS. As an important part of the Binance ecosystem, Binance Pool makes full use of its advantages in technology, capital, the exchange business, industry resources, and other areas in order to offer its users not only the ultimate mining experience but also a one-stop hub for mining-trading services. \n Binance Pool has a growing network, mining nodes are deployed in America, Europe, Southern China, Northern China, etc. Miners registered on the Binance Pool are automatically connected to the nearest node to ensure stable and reliable mining operations. \n  \n 1. Settlement method \n As Binance Pool uses the FPPS settlement model for BTC, miners’ income won’t be affected by the luck value. Earnings of theoretical income and trading fees are distributed to workers based on hashrate. \n 2. Calculation \n The theoretical earnings and transaction fee rates for the day can be found in the block explorer. They should be under the average block transaction fee rate for the current settlement period. \n 3. Settlement cycle \n 00:00 (UTC) each day - 00:00 (UTC) the next day. \n 4. Payment time \n Once earnings settlement calculations are complete, earnings will be credited to miner’s Funding Wallet by 10:00 (UTC) each day. \n Users with high hashrate can apply for Binance Pool VIP to enjoy VIP benefits, such as access to independent lines (nodes), which are stable and hidden to prevent attacks. \n Binance Pool has always been committed to improving miners income. With the launch of merged mining for BTC and ELA, miners can achieve higher profitability by using their hashrate to receive mining rewards in both tokens as well as additional bonuses from Binance Pool. \n 1. Gift ratios \n The reward ratio for merged mining earnings is based on the official market index price. Please refer to the latest notices from Binance Pool for the exact ratios. \n 2. Configure merged mining \n You can configure the ELA address from [Mining Account Settings]. \n 3. Payment \n The merged mining income will be distributed before 10:00 (UTC) on the 1st of each natural month. \n Mining Account is used to classify and configure miners and connect your mining equipment to the platform. They can also be used to manage multiple proxy servers, monitor multiple mining farms, etc. \n Please note that once a sub-account is created, it cannot be deleted or canceled. You can set up multiple accounts to suit your different needs. \n Watcher Links allow you to view the miner’s operation status and calculate hash rates in read-only mode without having to log in to your Binance Mining Account. For more details, please refer to What Is Watcher Link and How to Create It. \n According to the operating principles of miners, tasks from the mining pool are continuously accepted, and the miner sends the results of the calculation back to the mining pool. However, there is a delay in communication between the miner and the mining pool. This network delay results in invalid submissions, which is known as the rejection rate.  \n Rejection rate refers to the proportion of invalid submission out of the total number of submissions. The lower the rejection rate, the higher the working efficiency of the miner. \n Rejection Rate = Number of Rejections / Total Submissions = (Number of Expired Submissions + Number of Repeats + Other) / (Number of Submissions Received + Number of Expired Submissions + Other). \n  \n "

        "answer_tittle": "1. How to choose my mining machine (miners)?",
        "answer": "Binance Mining Pool supports various models of miners, such as WhatsMiner, Antminer, Avalon Miner, or Innosilicon miner. You can purchase them from the manufacturers official websites directly. \n You can choose newer miner models with lower power consumption and higher hashrate. \n Binance Pool does not provide hardware support. If you’re experiencing technical issues with your miner, it’s best to contact your miner’s manufacturer. \n Choose one that has been offering miner hosting services for at least two years with stable grid power and has a good reputation in the industry. You can check online reviews and ask around the crypto community on Twitter, Reddit, etc. before committing. \n For business inquiries related to hosting services, please contact Binance Pool. \n The setup works as long as one out of the three servers shows an Alive status. Three servers enable you to switch to a second pool when there is a problem with the one youre using, which can effectively reduce earnings loss. We suggest that you configure the first one to the “Binance pool server 8888”, the second to “443” or “3333”, and the third to another mining pool server. \n Please note that some operators may block the “3333” server port, such as the China Unicom. \n  \n It could take up to 15 minutes for the miner to reach a normal hashrate after reboot. If the miner restarts automatically, try changing to a new PSU to test if it was due to an abnormality in the power source. \n If the hashrate displayed on the hash board is lower than the actual hashrate, re-plug the hash board cables (or replace the damaged cables) and restart the miner. If the issue persists, please contact the miner manufacturer for further technical support. \n If the hash board is connected but the hashrate and the number of chips are showing 0, or the temperature reading is abnormal (different from other hash boards), try replugging the hash board cables and restart the miner. If the issue persists, please contact the miner manufacturer for further technical support. \n Run a speed test and verify that your internet connection is working. \n For example, the normal working temperature of a WhatsMiner is about 60 - 85°C. If the miners temperature exceeds 85°C, you can improve ventilation and lower the miners temperature by installing a water curtain, air conditioner, fan, or other cooling equipment. \n The miner may have loose cables, damaged chips, etc. Please contact the manufacturers customer support. \n You can contact the mining pool when you discover such data discrepancies. In some cases, mining pools could be stealing computing power from miners. However, Binance Pool can guarantee that this never happens to you at our mining pools. The following are some possible reasons: \n Ping is used to determine whether your computer can successfully exchange (send and receive) data with the server. The test results will show you whether the network is running smoothly. \n 1. On the computer connected to the same network as your miner, type cmd into the search bar and select Command Prompt. \n 2. In the Command Prompt window, type ping btc.mining_pool _address and press [Enter] to view the data packet results. \n Common signs that the miner is infected include but are not limited to: \n Please refer to your miner manufacturer’s official website. \n Binance Pool has a growing network, mining nodes are deployed in America, Europe, Southern China, Northern China, etc. Miners registered on the Binance Pool are automatically connected to the nearest node to ensure stable and reliable mining operations. \n The Binance Pool fee rate is 4%. High hashrate users can apply for Binance Pool VIP to enjoy lower fee rates. \n Mining Account is used to classify and configure miners and connect your mining equipment to the platform. They can also be used to manage multiple proxy servers, monitor multiple mining farms, etc. \n Please note that once a sub-account is created, it cannot be deleted or canceled. You can set up multiple accounts to suit your different needs.  \n Please refer to What Is Binance Mining Account and How to Create It for more details. \n Active workers are miners that are connected to the pool and submitting a hashrate. Inactive workers are disconnected miners that aren’t submitting hashrates. You can view all your miners’ statuses from [Statistics]. \n You can delete inactive workers from [Workers]. To restore an active miner, simply restart it. \n Users with a high hashrate can apply for Binance Pool VIP to enjoy added benefits, such as access to independent lines (nodes), which are stable and hidden to prevent attacks.  \n If you’ve reached a BTC hashrate of 20PH/s, you can apply to be a Binance Pool VIP. \n There are 9 VIP tiers for Binance Pool users. In addition to mining pool benefits, VIP users can also enjoy other benefits on the Binance ecosystem. For more information, please visit Fee Schedule. \n Watcher Links allow you to view the miner’s operation status and calculate hash rates in read-only mode without having to log in to your Binance Mining Account. For more details, please refer to What Is Watcher Link and How to Create It. \n Please check the followings: \n Please check the following: \n Earnings are settled between 00:00 to 04:00 UTC and credited before 10:00 UTC. There is no minimum payment threshold. \n Yes, we support merged mining. \n Binance Pool has always been committed to improving miners income. With the launch of merged mining for BTC and ELA, miners can achieve higher profitability by using their hashrate to receive mining rewards in both tokens as well as additional bonuses from Binance Pool. \n Merged mining earnings are settled simultaneously as BTC earnings and will be automatically credited before 10:00 UTC daily. Merged mining rewards will only be paid according to the ratio when the main currency payment is split. Please wait patiently for the payment to arrive. \n Sometimes the network instability is caused by technical maintenance, which generally takes from 30 minutes to 2 hours. \n The network disruptions may also be caused by attacks either on the Bitcoin network or mining pool servers. \n If you cannot receive an SMS verification code or verification email after trying all the above, please change your phone number or email address and try to verify your account again. You can contact Customer Support. \n Simply stop using your account if you no longer mine with Binance Pool. We’re currently unable to process any account closing requests. \n The hashrate update periods of the miner and the mining pool are different. For example, the hashrate displayed in the pool is an average of the last 15 minutes, while the miners data is refreshed every 5 seconds. \n The earnings are settled daily and credited to the Mining Account before 10:00 UTC each day. \n There is no minimum payment amount. Mining income will be paid directly to your Mining Account. \n The rejected shares are shares that your miner failed to submit to the mining pool due to network instability. The rejection rate is the proportion of the rejected shares to the total number of submitted shares. The lower the rate, the higher the efficiency of the miner. \n Rejection Rate = Rejected Shares / Total Shares = Stale Shares + Duplicates + Other Rejected) / (Received Shares + Stale Shares + Duplicates + Other Rejected) \n *A normal range for the rejection rate is within 2%. \n The luck value of a block is the ratio of the actual workload to the difficulty of mining. When it comes to mining, luck can play an important role. \n If the workload is lower than the mining difficulty, the luck value increases. The higher the luck value, the greater the earnings and vice versa.  \n Please note that it is common for the luck value to fluctuate. The longer the mining time, the closer the final luck value gets to 100%.  As Binance Pool uses the FPPS settlement model for BTC, miners’ income won’t be affected by the luck value. \n Workload is the hash power contribution of each miner to the probability of finding a block. Mining difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to mine a block in the entire network. It is based on changes in the networks hashrate. \n "

        "answer": "Litecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency powered by the Scrypt Proof of Work algorithm. LTC aims to provide an alternative to Bitcoin by making modifications to the original Bitcoin Protocol. Litecoin (LTC) was one of the first altcoins created. The Litecoin network was launched on 13 October 2011. LTC is still one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization since it was first created.  \n Litecoin aims to make it easier for merchants to accept LTC payments by making transactions faster than on the Bitcoin blockchain. Litecoin and Bitcoin do have a few key differences, for example, transactions are faster on Litecoin and it has a larger total supply (84 million LTC). In addition, Litecoin’s halvings were altered as well. Bitcoin halves every 210,000 blocks, while Litecoin halves every 840,000 blocks. \n Antminer (e.g. L5, L3+) \n INNOSILICON (e.g. A6+)    \n Or any miners that support the Scrypt Proof of Work algorithm \n 1.

        "answer": "Hashrate resale allows users to transfer a portion of the hashrate held in their name to another users name, either as an absolute value or as a percentage. This provides different types of hashrate suppliers with a flexible way to allocate their hashrate, while also providing a flexible solution for hashrate distribution among miners working in mining cooperatives. \n Step 1: Go to Hashrate Resale under Account Management on the sub-account from which youd like to transfer the hashrate (Mining Account Management > More Settings > Hashrate Resale). \n Step 2: A window will pop up where you can enter the terms of your hashrate resale contract. \n Enter the name of the sub-account to which you want to transfer a portion of your hashrate, as well as the resale time, the transfer algorithm, and the the amount that youd like to transfer: \n 1). Hashrates can only be transferred between Binance Pool sub-accounts. A hashrate that \n  has been transferred to a sub-account cannot be transferred out of that sub-account. Once a hashrate has been transferred out of a sub-account, it cannot be transferred back in. \n 2). When selecting the resale time, please note that the time the transfer takes effect is calculated using UTC as the standard time. Hashrate resale will be effective from UTC 00:00 on the start date until UTC 00:00 on the end date. For example: \n In the example shown above, the hashrate resale will be effective from 00:00 UTC, December 22, 2020 until 00:00 UTC, January 22, 2021 on a cumulative 24-hour basis. \n After you successfully complete the contract, it will be in continuous effect. The contract officially takes effect at the time at which it is entered into. \n 3). Select the corresponding transfer algorithm: Select SHA256 to transfer BTC/BCH/BSV hashrate, or select Ethash to transfer ETH hashrate. \n 4). Enter the amount of hashrate you would like to transfer. The minimum transfer amount for SHA256 is 1TH/s, and the minimum transfer amount for Ethash is 1MH/s. \n Step 3: View your hashrate info and earnings. \n 1). Transferred hashrate cannot be viewed in the [Worker], [Statistics] interface. \n 2). You can view your hashrate resale history in the Account Management interface of your mining account. \n Both the account transferring the hashrate and the account receiving the hashrate must be Binance Pool accounts. Hashrates received by a sub-account cannot be transferred out, and hashrates transferred out of a sub-account cannot be transferred back in. \n Binance Pool supports hashrate resales for BTC/BCH/BSV (select SHA256), and ETH (select Ethash). \n For SHA256, the minimum hashrate resale amount is 1TH/s. For Ethash, the minimum resale amount is 1MH/s. \n After the hashrate resale is completed, the transfer will take effect at the next 00:00 UTC. \n Binance Pool only provides a platform for hashrate resale. Hashrate resale activities are carried out after the miners have come to a mutual agreement. Once a hashrate resale contract is generated, it cannot be altered before the end date. \n "

        "answer": "Binance Cloud Mining enables users that don’t have access to mining equipment to earn mining rewards from the Binance Pool. You can purchase hashrates from the Cloud Mining products and start accumulating rewards in your Funding Wallet.  \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and click [Finance] - [Mining Pool]. \n Go to [Cloud Mining]. \n 2. You will see all the available Cloud Mining products under [Market]. Choose a product and click [Buy Now]. \n 3. Adjust the hashrate to purchase and choose the currency to use. We support USDT (the USDT-to-USD exchange rate is 1:1). \n You will see the total payment amount, the estimated start time, and the duration. Read and agree to the service agreement and click [Confirm]. \n 4. Once the order is confirmed, Binance will deduct the corresponding amount from your Spot Wallet. Please ensure you have a sufficient balance in your Spot Wallet. \n Important note: \n Binance offers different Cloud Mining products with different duration and electrical power fees. By looking at a product’s electricity/historical output ratio, you can estimate its rate of return.  \n For example, products with a higher electricity/historical output ratio are more likely to generate a higher rate of return when the crypto price rises. However, the losses may also be higher when the crypto price drops.  \n Log in to your Binance account and go to [Finance] - [Mining Pool]. Click [Cloud Mining] - [My Orders].  \n Cloud Mining rewards will be distributed in accordance with the Binance Cloud Mining Terms of Use. Binance Cloud Mining settles daily from 00:00 (UTC) to 00:00 (UTC) the following day. Your daily mining income will be settled from 02:00 to 10:00 (UTC). After the settlement is complete, your mining income will be distributed to your Binance Funding Wallet. You can view more details from [My Orders] - [Earning History]. \n Log in to your Binance account and go to [Finance] - [Mining Pool]. Click [Cloud Mining] - [My Orders]. \n Once subscribed, your Cloud Mining order will be connected to Binance Pool before 04:00 (UTC) on the Thursday of the following week. Please note that the subscription period varies for presale products. Please refer to the description on the product. You can check the watcher link in [My Orders] to monitor the real-time operation status of your hashrate. To view the revenue and runtime of a specific order, go to [Earnings History].  \n The Total Hashrate Online Rate refers to the total proportion of the subscription period when the hashrate from a purchased Cloud Mining product is delivered and online. This is a key performance indicator, which allows users to review their mining performance with the Cloud Mining product they have purchased. \n Upon the end of your Cloud Mining product’s subscription period, you can view your Total Hashrate Online Rate via [Cloud Mining] - [My Orders] - [Earnings History]. Alternatively, you can calculate your Total Hashrate Online Rate for a Cloud Mining Product using the equation below: \n Total Hashrate Online Rate = [Total hashrate delivered / (Hashrate purchased * Mining duration)] * 100% \n Suppose that a user has completed a Cloud Mining order for a daily hashrate of 1 Th/s, and the mining duration for this order is 30 days.  \n If the total hashrate delivered over the subscription period is 28.85 Th/s, the user’s Total Hashrate Online Rate is equivalent to [28.85 Th/s / (1 Th/s * 30)] * 100% = 96.17% \n In line with the industry standard across various cloud mining platforms, Binance Pool will ensure a Total Hashrate Online Rate of at least 95% for all Cloud Mining products by the end of the corresponding subscription period.  \n If the Total Hashrate Online Rate falls below 95% during the subscription period due to force majeure events and other unforeseen factors, Binance Pool will implement the following measures to protect users interests and ensure that the final Total Hashrate Online Rate is at least 95%: \n Mining hashrate for Cloud Mining product subscriptions may not be delivered in time due to force majeure and other unforeseen factors, such as power outages, electricity supply issues, site maintenance, or network problems.  \n Should this occur, Binance Pool will adopt the responses stated under the “What happens if the Total Hashrate Online Rate falls below 95%?” section, to best protect users’ interests. \n Duration: The validity period of the Cloud Mining product, calculated from the time the computing power goes online. You will get an average online rate service level above 95%. \n Hashrate Unit: Binance Cloud Mining products use the “Th/s” of Bitcoins SHA256 algorithm as a single unit of hashrate. \n Hashrate Fee: The per Th/s per day hashrate renting fee for the specific Cloud Mining product. \n Electricity Fee: The per Th/s per day hashrate electricity fee for the specific Cloud Mining product. \n Historical Output: Based on the theoretical output of the unit from 00:00 (UTC) the previous day to 00:00 (UTC) the next day, converted from the BTC/USDT price at 00:00 (UTC).  \n Please note that historical output is not an accurate prediction of future output, nor should it be used to estimate the digital assets you will be awarded for contributing cloud mining computational power to a mining pool. \n Estimated Mining Start Date: The estimated mining start date for regular Binance Cloud Mining products is 04:00 (UTC) on the Thursday of the following week the user places the order. Please note that the subscription period varies for presale products. Please refer to the description on the product. \n Runtime: The daily average online computing power rate based on the mining rig operation between 00:00 (UTC) and 00:00 (UTC) the following day. Please note that the hashrate delivered on the first day may not meet the daily average hashrate stipulated in the contract due to different starting timelines of the hashrate connection. However, the total hashrate delivered over the duration of the contract will meet the required service level. \n Total Hashrate Online Rate: The total proportion of the subscription period when the hashrates from a purchased Cloud Mining product is delivered and online. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is DeFi?",
        "answer": "Video Tutorial \n The term DeFi stands for “Decentralized Finance”. Unlike CeFi (Centralized Finance), our existing monetary system, DeFi provides users with decentralized financial services through smart contracts on a blockchain. \n Currently, DeFi projects (DApps) have not been fully adopted for two main reasons - lack of public awareness and complicated and non-intuitive user interface. This is why Binance introduced DeFi staking to help proxy users to participate in related decentralized projects. This allows users to access DeFi in a user-friendly and straightforward manner. Without the need to manage private keys, acquire resources, make trades, or perform other complicated tasks required to participate in DeFi Staking. By simply clicking [Stake now], you can participate in DeFi Staking projects and earn high returns easily and safely. \n Login to your Binance account, click [Finance] - [Binance Earn].  \n Scroll down to [Locked Staking] and click [View More]. \n Click [DeFi Staking] and you can see all the DeFi staking projects currently available in Binance Earn with an estimated annual yield, staking duration (flexible or fixed), minimum locked amount, and the staking status. \n Once you choose the asset you want to stake, click [Stake Now] to see details about this staking offer. \n You can choose either Flexible or Locked staking and adjusting the duration. You will then see the [Estimated annual percentage yield (est. APY)]. \n *During the staking period, your assets will be locked on-chain, so you wont be able to withdraw or perform any transactions with the staked assets. \n [Available amount] shows the available balance in your Spot Wallet that you can use to stake on Binance Earn. There is a minimum required limit for staking, and if your balance is lower than that, you wont be able to stake. Also, please note that if the total remaining quota of the product is lower than your available balance in your Spot Wallet, you will only be able to purchase the remaining amount for staking. \n Enter the [Lock Amount] you want to stake, check the Staking Summary on the right, read and agree to Binance Staking Service Agreement and click [Confirm purchase]. \n You can find your staking details from [Wallet] - [Earn] - [DeFi Staking]. Once you staked the product successfully, interests will be calculated starting at 00:00 (UTC) the following day and distributed to your Spot Wallet every day after 00:00 (UTC).  \n For Locked Staking, when the staking period ends, your staked assets will be redeemed automatically and the funds will be returned to your Spot Wallet. \n If you want to redeem your assets before the locked period ends, click [Redeem earlier]. Please note that unlocking your staked assets requires a specific time based on the specifications of the chain youre staking on. If you redeem your staked assets in advance, you will lose your interest and the interests you have generated will be deducted when your assets are returned. \n Risk Warning \n Binance strives to offer its users only the best DeFi Mining projects. However, Binance only acts as a platform to showcase projects and provide users with related services, such as accessing funds on behalf of the user and distributing earnings, etc. Binance does not assume liability for any losses incurred due to project on-chain contract security issues. \n No. Binance only acts as a platform to showcase projects and provide users with related services, such as accessing assets on DeFi projects through a proxy and distributing earnings, etc. Binance does not bear any liability for losses incurred as a result of on-chain contract security. \n DeFi Staking subscriptions are closed during 23:50-00:10 (UTC) daily. No interest is accumulated on products purchased on the day of the subscription. Once funds are successfully allocated to Locked Staking, earnings are calculated beginning at 00:00 (UTC) the following day. The minimum earnings calculation period is one day; earnings for a period of less than one day will not be included in the earnings distribution. \n Currently, the lock-up period for regular products is 1 day. Funds will be unlocked and returned to your Spot Wallet on T + 1. However, as we support more types of products, the lock-up periods will vary. You can check the lock-up periods for different products from Binance Earn. \n No, early redemption will, unfortunately, deduct all interest-based income. The assets allocated to staking are locked in the smart contract on the chain, and the redemption operation requires a more complicated manual operation, including on-chain transfer fees. Please choose the appropriate lock-up time when subscribing to DeFi Staking products. \n There is no principal penalty mechanism for early redemption. The reduction of the principal is made to deduct the interest that has been distributed. \n For example, User A subscribes to 7-day staking utilizing BNB at 9:00 PM on Oct 9. The income will be calculated at 8:00 AM on Oct 10, and the user will receive the previous days lock-up income after 8:00 AM on Oct 11 in his Spot Wallet. If the user decides to redeem in advance at 4:00 PM on Oct 12, the paid income from the previous days will be deducted from the principal, therefore reducing the principal payout amount. \n Rebate on Early Redemption \n In the case of early redemption of locked DeFi Staking positions, 5% of all distributed rewards, which would otherwise be fully forfeited due to early redemption, will be used to create a 90-day staking position. Users will receive the staking rewards daily and can redeem the principal amount (i.e., 5% of distributed rewards from the original staking subscription) from the newly created 90-day staking position once the staking period expires. This position cannot be redeemed early and will appear as “Re-Stake Activity” in users’ Earn Wallets. \n Early redemption takes up to 72 hours to process and return your assets. This is because the locked assets are used to participate in the on-chain contract. Redemption and distribution actions also take a certain amount of time to be fulfilled. \n For example, User A redeemed a BNB-based DeFi Staking product in advance at 9:00 PM on Oct 9. The unlock period is one day. The unlock period will begin at 8:00 AM on Oct 10 and end at 8:00 AM on Oct 11. Therefore, the user will receive the principal at the earliest on the morning of Oct 11. Before investing in DeFi products, please consider the limitation of the unlock period before staking your assets. \n  \n Disclaimer:  \n This document may have been translated and published in different languages. In the event of any inconsistency, misstatements, omissions, or errors appearing in any translated version, the English version shall prevail. \n "

        "answer": "Tutorial Video \n Dual Investment gives you an opportunity to buy or sell cryptocurrency at your desired price and date in the future, while earning high rewards no matter which direction the market goes.  \n Benefits of using Dual Investment \n Whether you’re an advanced trader or simply a HODLer that wants to earn some extra rewards, there are many different reasons why you may decide to use Dual Investment. Some of the most common scenarios include:  \n There are two types of Dual Investment products: “Buy Low” and “Sell High”.  \n Buy Low products give you a chance to buy your desired crypto (such as BTC) at a lower price in the future with stablecoins (BUSD or USDT).  \n In both scenarios, you will first earn rewards in stablecoins. Once the Target Price is reached, your subscription amount and the rewards earned will be used to buy BTC. \n Sell High products give you a chance to sell your existing crypto (such as BNB) at a higher price in the future (for BUSD).  \n In both scenarios, you will first earn rewards in your existing currency (BNB). Once the Target Price is reached, your subscription amount and the rewards earned will be sold for BUSD.  \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and click [Earn] - [Dual Investment]. \n You will enter the Beginner Mode by default, which is designed for new Dual Investment users.

To view your subscription, go to [Orders] - [Earn History] - [Dual Investment].  \n Auto-Compound is a new feature that will automatically re-subscribe your Dual Investment plan on the Settlement Date.  \n Upon enabling the feature, the system will assist you to re-subscribe a new position, with a Settlement Date occurring on the next available Settlement Date from the current date.  \n The Settlement Date for BTC and ETH occurs every Tuesday and Friday. The Settlement Date for all other digital assets is on every Friday. \n As long as the Auto-Compound feature is enabled, your Dual Investment plan will be automatically re-subscribed to the next available Settlement Date on the Settlement Date. You can enable/disable the Auto-Compound plan 30 minutes before the Settlement Date.  \n To enable the Auto-Compound feature, toggle on the button next to [Auto-Compound] when setting up your plan. Then choose either the basic plan or the advanced plan. \n If you already have an existing Dual Investment position and wish to enable/disable the Auto-Compound feature, you can do so via the Earn Wallet. \n You can select between 2 types of Auto-Compound plans.  \n 1. Basic Plan \n 2. Advanced Plan \n The system will auto-compound based on the Market Price at your settlement time and choose a new Target Price based on the current Market Price. For example, if you’re using the Auto-Compound and the Buy Low Target Price is not reached, the system will set a new Target Price at 10% away from the current Market Price. Suppose the current Market Price is $20,000 for BTC, then the new Target Price will be 10% lower at $18,000. \n Beginner Mode is designed for new Dual Investment users.

        "answer": "In this article, let’s take Binance as an example to see how to check the transaction ID (TxID).  \n If you deposited to Binance but the funds are not showing, you may also check the transaction status and TxID on the platform you withdrew. \n A transaction ID (TxID) or transaction hash is a unique string of characters given to every transaction that’s verified and added to the blockchain. In other words, a TxID is an identification number that labels each transaction on the blockchain. With TxID, you can look up your deposit and withdrawal history. \n You can find your TxID from the platform you made a withdrawal. For example, you can find the TxID from [Transaction History] on Binance, or through the following steps. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account. Click [Wallet] and select [Overview] from the drop-down menu. \n 2. Click [Transaction History]. Here you can see all your deposit or withdrawal history. You can find the TxID under [TxID]. \n You can also access your transaction history from [Wallets] - [Spot] - [Transaction History] on the Binance App. Tap on the relevant transaction to find the TxID. \n When you contact Binance Support for issues regarding deposit or withdrawal, you can provide the TxID of the transaction to our CS team so we can better assist you. \n You can also click on the TxID to see the status of the relevant transaction in that blockchain explorer. Note that your funds will be transferred to the relevant block after the nodes have confirmed the transaction. If the network is congested, it may take longer for your funds to arrive. \n For more information, refer to the FAQs below: \n Why Hasn’t My Deposit Credited? \n Why Hasn’t My Withdrawal Arrived? \n  \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is SegWit?",
        "answer": "Binance supports using Segregated Witness (SegWit) to withdraw Bitcoin to SegWit (bech32) addresses. \n SegWit is an improvement over the current bitcoin blockchain, which reduces the size needed to store transactions in a block. By separating the transaction signatures from bitcoin transactions, SegWit allows more transactions to fit within one block to support smoother and quicker Bitcoin transactions. \n To learn more about SegWit, please refer to the Binance Academy’s article: A Beginner’s Guide to SegWit. \n When you choose Bitcoin SegWit (under the BTC network) to withdraw your BTC, make sure the corresponding platform or wallet supports SegWit. If you choose an unsupported network or incompatible assets, your funds may be lost and cannot be recovered. \n To learn more about how to deposit or withdraw funds, you may refer to the tutorial. \n You should choose the correct network when you transfer the funds. Not all wallets and exchanges support all 3 addresses. \n 1. Can I use the SegWit address to send BTC from Binance to the original Bitcoin addresses? \n Yes. SegWit is backward compatible with previous Bitcoin addresses. You can safely send transactions to any external Bitcoin address or wallet. However, make sure the corresponding exchange or wallet supports SegWit(bech32). If you choose an unsupported network or incompatible assets, your funds will be lost. \n 2. Does SegWit allow me to send other assets besides Bitcoin to my BTC SegWit address? \n No. Digital assets sent to the wrong currency address will result in the permanent loss of those assets. \n "

        "answer": "The growing popularity of crypto has led to a rise in scams preying on unsuspecting users. To help safeguard investors, Binance employs various anti-scam measures within its withdrawal pages. These measures are designed to ensure a secure and reliable crypto experience for Binance users. \n Before you can initiate withdrawals, you must complete the Verification Questionnaire. This questionnaire ensures you’re fully aware of the risks involved. The questions cover key facts about your transaction, such as the nature, purpose, and the reasons that prompted you to initiate the transaction. If your answers are insufficient, you’ll be required to provide additional details. You can only proceed with your withdrawal after you pass the questionnaire.  \n If your recipient has been flagged as high-risk for fraud by multiple Binance users, our system will give you time to assess whether you’re at risk of being defrauded.  \n Attempting to withdraw to addresses that are flagged as high-risk for scams or exhibiting abnormal behavior will trigger warning messages. These alerts aim to educate you on the risks associated with certain withdrawal addresses.  \n Fake platforms often deceive users into believing they own an “address.” In reality, the address is directly controlled by the fraudulent platform. Remember: Personal wallet addresses are only under your ownership if you have access to the private keys.  \n Only proceed with the withdrawal after you’ve read the warning message and determined your actions don’t pose any risks.   \n Binance restricts withdrawals for various reasons, including abnormal user profiles, transaction patterns, operating behavior, devices, or environmental factors.  \n For example, Binance may temporarily disable your account’s withdrawals if you repeatedly send funds to a blacklisted address. The cool-down period offers you time to reconsider your actions and consider whether you’re engaging with a scammer.  \n If you need help identifying the potential risks or you’ve confirmed the withdrawal does/does not carry any risk, please contact Binance Support. Our support team will assist you further on your request. \n Binance’s preventative measures are temporary restrictions designed to secure your funds. By staying informed about prevalent crypto scams and scrutinizing the potential risks involved with each transaction, you can safeguard your digital assets and enjoy a safer crypto experience.  \n Scammers often organize Ponzi schemes by promoting fraudulent services or products with multiple VIP user levels. These scams typically involve at least three layers of users, though they can have as few as two. \n To draw more participants, scammers promise high returns on investments. Funds from new investors are used to repay early investors.  \n Fraudsters create counterfeit online stores that allow you to sign up as merchants or consumers. The products listed on these websites often carry significantly lower prices than market rates. However, once payment is made in crypto, the goods are never delivered. \n This fraudulent practice can also extend to individual sellers advertising below-market-rate items. \n Some scammers impersonate Binance Support staff to trick you into sending money or sharing their account details. Their tactics may include urging you to take action under the pretext of completing KYC, resolving account restrictions, or accessing exclusive offers. \n Scammers will also pose as representatives from third-party organizations, such as government agencies, financial institutions, or other prominent crypto services.  \n Scammers may use doctored receipts to falsely claim they’ve sent funds to your bank account before initiating a chargeback.  \n Scammers entice you with promises of free crypto, asking for a small deposit to secure the prize. This type of scam typically starts with an invite to a Telegram or Discord group.  \n Scammers lure you with investment opportunities that promise guaranteed returns. They might endorse a specific platform or even present themselves as crypto experts, investors, or brokers to gain your trust.  \n Be wary of “guaranteed returns” that seem exceptionally high or unrealistic. This is a telltale sign of a scam. Perform a background check on the individual or platform before initiating any transactions.  \n Scammers create fake job postings, requesting personal information or a “deposit” to receive a nonexistent position and unlock your “full salary.” \n Scammers establish romantic relationships with you before requesting financial assistance.  \n Withdrawal limitations and the error message you received are both part of Binance’s anti-scam measures. These measures aim to protect users by making them aware of potential scams and the associated risks. The restrictions are temporary and can only last up to a maximum of 24 hours. We impose these restrictions to encourage users to verify the receiver and transaction details before confirming their withdrawal.  \n Withdrawal limitations and the error message you received are both part of Binance’s anti-scam measures.

This fee is not paid to Binance but miners or validators, who are responsible for processing the transactions and securing the respective blockchain network. \n Binance must pay these fees to miners to ensure that transactions are processed. Since transaction fees are dynamic, you will be charged according to the current network conditions. The fee amount is based on an estimate of the network transaction fees and can fluctuate without notice due to factors such as network congestion. Please check the most updated fee displayed on the withdrawal page. \n Please note that there is a minimum amount for each withdrawal request. If the amount is too little, you won’t be able to request a withdrawal. You can refer to the Deposit & Withdrawal Fees page to check the minimum withdrawal amount and transaction fees of each cryptocurrency. However, please note that the minimum withdrawal amount and fees can change without notice due to unforeseeable factors, such as network congestion. \n You can also find the current transaction fees charged and the minimum withdrawal amount on the withdrawal page. \n Please note that the minimum withdrawal amount and transaction fees will change depending on the network you are using.  \n Please make sure you select the correct network. If the address you are withdrawing to is an ERC20 address (Ethereum blockchain), you must select the ERC20 option before making the withdrawal. DO NOT select the cheapest fee option.

        "answer_tittle": "6. How can I report fraud or scams?",
        "answer": "P2P (Peer-to-Peer) trading is also known as C2C (Customer-to-Customer) trading in some regions. In P2P trading, the users directly buy or sell cryptocurrencies from each other on a P2P platform, exchange, or marketplace. \n A P2P platform serves as the trade facilitator by providing a platform for buyers and sellers to broadcast their offers. At the same time, it can ensure the safety and timely delivery of digital assets during trade execution. \n No, the offers you see on the P2P market are not offered by Binance. Binance serves as a platform to facilitate P2P trading, but the offers are provided by users on an individual basis. \n All online trades are protected by escrow. When an ad is posted, the amount of crypto for the ad is automatically reserved from the sellers Funding Wallet. This means that if the seller does not release your crypto, the Customer Support agents can release the crypto to you from the reserved funds. \n If youre selling, never release the assets before confirming that you have received the funds from the buyer. Please note that some payment methods buyers use are not instant and may face the risk of chargeback. \n 4.1. All Binance users must complete Identity Verification to access Binance products and service offerings, including P2P trading. You can access the Identity Verification from [User Center] - [Identification]. \n Before trading on P2P, you must enable SMS verification and at least one 2FA device (email, Binance/Google Authenticator, or security key) from [Security]. \n 4.2. You’ll also need to add your preferred methods for receiving/sending payments. Log in to your Binance App and tap [Trade] - [P2P]. \n Tap [Profile] - [Payment Method]. \n Tap [Add a new payment method] - [All Payment Methods] to select your desired methods. \n 4.3. Why do I have to add a preferred payment method? \n P2P transactions are trades carried out directly between two users. This means that fiat currency can only be transferred between the two users if the buyers and sellers payment method match.  \n For example, User A has a debit card from ING Bank and is going to use the EUR deposited to Binance to buy crypto. In order to complete User A’s P2P order, the system will only match sellers who also have an ING Bank account that can receive EUR transfers from User A. \n 4.4. Why do I need to enable 2FA? \n In addition to security concerns during login, all users who trade on the P2P market need to receive payments, release coins, and perform other operations during the buying and selling process. These operations require users to enter a two-factor authentication code to verify that they are carrying out the transaction themselves. \n 4.5. Why do I need to complete Identity Verification? \n P2P transactions are trades carried out directly between two users. After the buyer and seller are matched, both parties must verify their identities through real-name KYC (Know-Your-Customer). You must confirm the identity of the counterparty (i.e., the person sending fiat currency to your account/the account you’re sending money to) is identical to the name shown on the order details page.  \n You can buy and sell your crypto and fiat balance through Binance P2P on Binance.com and the Binance App. Please go to the P2P market for the latest supported currencies. \n The P2P trading function is available on version 1.17.0 (Android)/2.6.0 (iOS) or higher. Download the Binance App here: \n Binance P2P charges transaction fees from makers for every completed order. Here’s an overview of the fees rates: \n *Please note that some payment method service providers may charge extra transaction fees.  \n 30-day order completion rate = 1 - total number of canceled orders in the last 30 days / total number of completed orders in the last 30 days \n If you are the buyer and you canceled a P2P order, this will affect your completion rate, whereas the seller’s completion rate will not be affected. \n If you are the seller and the buyer fails to accept the order or does not complete the payment, then only the buyer’s completion rate will be affected. \n  \n You can sell from a minimum of  0.01 BTC to a maximum of 5 BTC (200 BTC for merchants) per trade. \n For other crypto: \n  \n Yes, the set of fiat currencies you can trade is determined by your Identity Verification region. For example, if you and the counterparty are both located in Southeast Asia, then it is highly likely that you can use both VND and PGK to trade. Binance P2P is constantly adding more fiat currency choices for users from different regions. \n For floating-price ads: \n For fixed-price ads: \n Note: The information provided above may not represent the most current figures and is for reference purposes only. Always refer to the numbers displayed on your Ads Posting Page for the most up-to-date information. \n Yes. You can go to the [Ads] tab to take them offline, or close the ads by tapping [...] - [Close]. \n You will receive SMS, email, and app push notifications if you have enabled the services. To set up, go to [Profile] - [P2P Notifications] to choose the notifications you wish to enable. \n If you’re on the Binance website, click the Binance Support icon on the bottom right. \n Click [Get Support] and enter “report scam”. \n You’ll see the relevant information and a report link. \n If you’re using the app, go to [P2P Help Center] and tap [Chat Now]. \n Scroll down and tap [Get Support]. Enter “report scam” and you’ll see a report link. \n You may also tap on the username on the P2P market and tap [Report] to report a user. Please note that you can only report the counterparty via their profile if you have traded with them before. \n You may also tap [Report] in the chat to directly report the user if you detect fraudulent activity during a trade. \n  \n You have to follow the instructions provided on the order details page and make a transfer to the seller’s account with the indicated payment method. After that, please click [Transferred, notify seller]. Please note that your fiat balance will not be deducted automatically by clicking [Transferred, notify seller], you have to make the transfer yourself. \n You can add up to 20 payment methods. Please note that you must enable the payment methods before posting ads or taking orders. If you are posting ads, you can only show 5 payment methods on a single ad. \n No. For security reasons, we only allow accounts with the exact name as your Identity Verification. If there is a mistake in the verified name, you will have to contact customer support to correct it before you can add the payment methods. \n If you use a third-party bank/payment account to pay the seller, your P2P activities may face a 15-day sanction period. You might be permanently banned from P2P trading if you receive 3 warnings from the CS Team. \n The payment window is usually pre-set by the maker. When posting ads, makers can choose how long they would like to receive/make payment, ranging from 15 minutes to 6 hours (depending on the fiat currency). \n The seller will be suspended for taking orders for a certain period if the system has detected the seller has long release time or does not release crypto on purpose.   \n You can change your nickname (alias) from [Profile]. Tap on the edit button next to your current nickname to edit. It can only be modified once every 180 days. \n Please set your nickname (alias) professionally and do not use your real name. \n We reserve the right to make changes if we deem the nickname offensive or improper. \n The yellow badge differentiates Verified Merchants from regular users. \n Verified Merchants are experienced, frequent traders who enjoy higher levels of trading limits, lower fees, and more advanced trading tools. \n The diamond badge is assigned to block trade merchants, whose ads are prioritized in the Block Trade Zone. \n The red Pro badge is assigned to “Pro merchants who have local crypto exchange licenses, their own payment gateways, or equivalent advanced qualifications. Every Pro merchant is strictly approved by the Binance P2P team. We highly encourage users to trade with Pro merchants for a better trading experience. \n The basic requirements for becoming a merchant are solid trading history and large trading volume. Applications are reviewed by the P2P team according to internal algorithms and regional requirements. Become a P2P Merchant now  \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What does the “Remaining Ad balance is less than its order minimum limit” error mean?",
        "answer": "You can customize the order limit for your P2P ads to limit the minimum and maximum amount of fiat or crypto assets the taker takes in a single order. For example, if you post a USDT/USD P2P buy ad and set 100 USD as the lower limit and 400 USD as the upper limit, this limits the taker to sell within 100 - 400 USD equivalent of USDT to you in each order.  \n Your ad will be fully filled if someone places a sell order of 400 USD, or places multiple orders between 100 - 400 USD that adds up to 400 USD in total. \n Therefore, lower limit < the amount a taker can take for each order < upper limit ≤ total fiat amount of the ad.  \n For example, the taker cannot take the ad with only 99 USD (lower limit = 100 USD) or 401 USD (upper limit = 400 USD). \n When you see this error message, it means that the remaining fiat or crypto asset balance of your ad is insufficient to cover the minimum order limit you set. Your ad will be invisible to users until you adjust the order limit. Alternatively, you may close the ad and post a new one. \n Let’s use the previous example to illustrate this. The lower and upper limits of your ad are 100 USD and 400 USD. A taker just bought 350 USD equivalent of USDT through your ad, and the remaining asset balance becomes 400 - 350 = 50 USD. As 50 USD is insufficient to meet the lower limit you set for this ad (100 USD), you will see this error message, and your ad will be taken down from the P2P market. \n To adjust the order limit, go to the P2P trading homepage on the Binance App and tap [Ads]. \n Here you can see all your ads. Tap on the dots and choose [Edit Detail] or [Quick Edit] to adjust the lower limit.  \n  \n To close the ad, tap [Close]. \n  \n To protect the remaining asset in your ads, the system will automatically close your online/offline buy/sell ads with a low remaining balance and return the assets to your Funding Wallet. Your ads will be closed based on the followings: \n 1. If the system detects that the remaining balance in the ad is lower than the minimum order limit; \n 2. Your ad has no ongoing appeals or pending orders; \n 3. Your ad didn’t receive any new orders in the last 14 days. Please note that the system will check your ad’s fiat/crypto balance and order limit weekly and automatically close unqualified ads. \n "

        "answer": "Binance has launched a Global P2P Merchants Program to enroll users as merchants on the Binance P2P platform. When you become a Binance P2P Merchant, you can earn profit by posting trading advertisements and completing P2P trades. You will also enjoy exclusive benefits, including special promotions, access to more trading tools, verified badges, dedicated customer support, and more. \n 1. Industry-leading security \n Every trade on Binance P2P goes through the escrow service to ensure secure and fair trading. Once a buyer marks the order as complete, Binance will hold your cryptocurrency in a temporary deposit until both parties confirm the transaction is successful. If any issues occur during the transaction, you can file an appeal, and the Customer Support team will mediate the problem. \n 2. Exclusive customer support \n If you have any inquiries or encounter an issue with the Binance P2P trading platform, you can seek dedicated one-on-one assistance from the Customer Support team via the Live Chat function.  \n 3. Special promotions for merchants \n Binance P2P often launches special fee discount promotions exclusive to P2P merchants, such as access to meetups, events and online webinars.   \n 4.

Go to [P2P User Center] and click [Become merchant].  \n 3. You will see a list of the requirements, including complete SMS and email authentication, complete advanced Identity Verification, and deposit a certain amount of USDT in your Funding Wallet. \n Once you meet all the requirements, click [Apply now] to submit your application.

        "answer_tittle": "1. Proof of payment scams ",
        "answer": "Below are the most popular P2P scams you should be aware of and the best practices to avoid them. \n When making online transactions on Binance P2P, it’s essential to double-check all payment-related information shared by your counterparty. Scammers can digitally manipulate screenshots and claim that they’ve upheld their part of the deal and pressure you into releasing your funds. If you comply without confirming that you’ve received the payment, you risk losing your money or digital assets with little to no chance of recovering them. \n Always check your bank account or e-wallet to confirm that you’ve received the funds from your counterparty before marking the transaction as complete.  \n  \n In this type of scam, fraudsters will send their victims an SMS text message that looks identical to the notifications sent by banks or wallet apps to notify the victim that they’ve received a payment from their counterparty. \n Make sure to check your bank account or e-wallet to confirm that you’ve received the funds from your counterparty. Don’t blindly trust the text message. Always log in to your bank accountor e-wallet and double-check whether you’ve received the funds.  \n  \n Scammers can initiate a chargeback (available for some payment methods) to retract the payment they’ve made to their counterparty. In many cases, fraudsters will process payments via a third-party account. \n If your counterparty tries to pay you with a cheque deposit, it’s most likely a scam because requesting a chargeback from cheque payments is very easy. If your counterparty insists on paying you with a cheque, don’t release the funds and file an appeal immediately.  \n Always check that the buyer’s name on the payment details matches their verified name on Binance. Don’t accept payments from third-party accounts. If it happens, file an appeal and refund the payment to the sending account. \n  Also, be aware of advanced scams like these: \n The scammer will pretend to be a reputable merchant looking to buy or sell crypto on Binance P2P. Theyll contact their victims on Telegram, WhatsApp, or social networking platforms and send the victim their bank account details and a link to a P2P ad to let them know theyll be making a payment via this account. The scammer will then ask the victim to confirm that theyve received the account details by having them copy them over to the chat on the order page.  \n The victim doesnt realize they are sharing the scammers bank account details in the chat of an unrelated buyer, who is also unaware of the scam. The victim then releases their crypto to the unrelated buyer, who unknowingly sends money to the scammers bank account.  \n If the victim tries to reverse the transaction by opening an appeal, there isnt much customer service can do. Because all communication with the fraudster took place outside the Binance P2P platform, and the buyer sent their funds to a third-party scammer account. \n Dont respond to any P2P trading requests outside of Binance P2P. Limit communication with your counterparty to the Binance P2P chat before or during a transaction. More importantly, if a buyer asks if they can make payment via a third-party transfer, remind them that transfers made from someone elses account violate P2P transaction policies. Also, double-check your counterpartys bank account details directly on the Binance P2P platform. Refrain from trusting information or offers received on external channels. \n  \n A triangle scam involves two scammers simultaneously placing two orders with the same seller. Scammer A makes an order for 5,000 USDT worth of crypto (order A), and Scammer B makes an order worth 6,000 USDT (order B).  \n Scammer B then transfers 5,000 USDT to the seller. At the same time, Scammer A marks order A as paid. The seller releases the crypto to Buyer A, thus completing order A for 5,000 USDT. Scammer B sends another 1,000 USDT to the seller, provides the 5,000 USDT payment proof they got from Buyer A, and pressures the seller to release digital assets under order B.  \n The fraudster’s goal is to make the seller release the funds immediately without verifying the transfer. It can be easy to release funds without verifying who initiated the transfer. If youre not being careful, you could be releasing the funds twice but only receive half or less of the assets being bought. \n Always check your bank account or e-wallet to confirm that youve received all the funds from your pending P2P transactions. Be careful with the proof of payment counterparties send you, and remember that scammers may try to reuse these proofs. \n  \n This type of scam involves scammers posing as Binance employees to offer fake services to steal peoples funds. The scammer will contact potential victims via unofficial emails or social media accounts that look like official Binance accounts. Theyll ask you in the P2P chat for your email address, claiming that its required by the Binance P2P Escrow service to confirm your payment. Then theyll send you an email that looks remarkably similar to official Binance emails to make you believe that you need to release the crypto first to receive the payment. \n Binance will never send emails asking you to complete a P2P transaction. Always release funds after receiving the payment. Pay attention to the username or email address. You can verify the authenticity of email addresses and site links on Binance by searching the senders address on this page.  \n  \n Note: Do not mention anyones name or share offline contact information in the chat. Payment must be submitted using the counterpartys specified payment method, and the name on the account must match your counterpartys verified name on Binance. \n  \n "

        "answer": "The Lite version is a simplified version of the Binance App. Its intuitive interface is designed with a reduced amount of information on the homepage, and users will only see the most basic features when they launch the App. With the Lite version, users new to crypto trading can easily buy and sell cryptocurrencies and view their assets with just a few taps.  \n If you’re an advanced trader, you can consider using the Pro version of the Binance App. For more details, please visit  How to Use the Pro Version on the Binance App to Buy and Sell Crypto. \n To use the Lite version, you need to: \n 1. Update your Binance App to the latest version. \n To check which version youre currently using, tap the [Profile] icon and select [Settings] - [About Us].  \n You can update the App to the latest version by tapping [Check for updates]. \n  \n 2. Toggle on/off the button to switch between [Binance Lite] and [Binance Pro]. \n You can buy cryptocurrencies using your fiat cash balance, credit/debit cards, or P2P trading in just a few steps on Binance Lite. Please note that you need to complete Identity Verification before buying crypto with a bank card. For more details, please refer to:  \n Currently, the Lite version supports purchasing crypto via P2P with certain fiat currencies. Please refer to the App for the most updated list of crypto we support. Once you enter the transaction amount in the P2P trading interface, the system will automatically match a fiat or P2P order for you. You will see the quote and can choose which channel to use for the transaction. \n You can sell cryptocurrencies to your cash balance, credit/debit card, or P2P trading on Binance Lite. We offer different fiat channels for users in different countries. Please refer to the App to see the available fiat channels for your country. Currently, the Lite version supports selling crypto via P2P with certain fiat currencies. Please refer to the App for the most updated list of crypto we support.  \n For more details, please refer to:  \n Quote prices are provided separately by the Fiat and P2P channels, and the pricing rules cause the quotes to differ between payment channels. \n The quotes you can see are determined by the fiat currency and crypto you selected in the App’s settings. For example, you will only see a fiat trading quote when placing a EUR order. When you place a VND order, you can see quotes from both channels. \n As mentioned, the Binance Lite mode is the default for all first-time users. It’s more user-friendly to those new to crypto trading, allowing them to quickly check prices and make purchases from the homepage dashboard. \n Despite having the more complex product functions removed from the Lite mode, the core features that are most frequently used are easily accessible from the navigation bar at the bottom. You can tap on the middle yellow icon to buy, sell, or convert crypto, or tap on the wallet icon to check your wallet balance, asset allocation, and portfolio value. \n Binance Pro offers versatile trading functionalities such as Futures Trading, Options Trading, and Margin Trading, to fulfill professional traders’ needs. The trading interface on the Pro version is more sophisticated and offers advanced charting tools and order types. In addition to the more complex interface, users can trade on Binance P2P with other users. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "Taker:",
        "answer": "Crypto markets are made up of makers and takers. Market makers create buy or sell orders that go on the order book, which aren’t executed immediately. For example, placing a limit order to sell 1 BTC when the price hits $50,000. These orders create liquidity for the market so that it’s easier for other traders to instantly buy or sell BTC when the condition is met. Traders that buy or sell instantly are called takers. In other words, takers fill the orders created by the makers. \n Exchanges typically incentivize makers to provide liquidity with lower fees for their orders. If you’ve checked our fee schedule, you will see that Binance charges different fees depending on whether you’re a maker or a taker. For VIP users, makers incur smaller fees than takers. Let’s dive deeper into both roles. \n When you place an order that trades immediately before going on the order book, you are a taker. This is regardless of whether you partially or fully fulfill the order. \n Trades from market orders are always takers, as market orders never go on the order book. These trades are taking volume off the order book, and therefore are taker trades. \n Limit immediate or cancel (IOC) and limit fill or kill (FOK) orders (accessible via the API) are also always takers orders. \n When you place an order that goes on the order book partially or fully, such as a limit order, any subsequent trades coming from that order will be maker trades. \n These orders add volume to the order book, help to make the market, and are therefore termed makers for any subsequent trades. \n Note: \n For more details, please refer to Market Makers and Market Takers Explained. \n  \n "

        "answer": "An order book is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific asset organized by price level. Buyers’ and sellers interests are represented via order books. An order book depicts the dynamic connection between buyers and sellers by visualizing a list of outstanding orders for a specific asset in real-time. \n The quantity of orders being bid on or offered at each price point, also known as market depth, is listed in an order book. They provide vital trading information, which increases market transparency. Depth and liquidity of the order book play a crucial role in price discovery.  \n Almost every exchange uses order books to list orders for various assets, such as equities, bonds, currencies, and even cryptocurrencies. Buy and sell information may show at the top and bottom of the screen or on the left and right sides. \n An order book is constantly updated in real-time throughout the day, which means they are dynamic and reflect the real-time intent of the market participants.  \n There are typically four parts to an order book: buy orders, sell orders, price, and size. \n The order book helps traders make more informed trading decisions. They can see order imbalances that may provide clues to an asset’s direction in the short term. \n You can customize the order book display using the following tools. \n 1. You can choose how prices display on the order book. For example, choosing [0.01] will display prices in 2 decimal places. \n 2. Checking the box next to [Display Avg.&Sum] will display a floating table.  \n You’ll be able to view the asset’s average price and your total base and quote asset holdings. \n 3. Choose [Amount] or [Cumulative] to view the order book depth by: \n 4. You can also enable the [Quick Switch Buy/Sell] function. The system will switch the trading direction automatically based on the price you select in the buy or sell order book, enabling you to quickly set up the order. \n For example, if you click a sell order price in the red area, the system will automatically switch to the buy side, and the price will be automatically filled in.  \n *Please note that the price you select may be taken by counterparties before you submit the order. \n 5. To go to the order book, click [More]. \n You’ll see the cumulative value of both quote and base assets for each price. The bar chart displayed beneath the order book represents the amount of buy and sell orders at various prices. \n Click [Depth] to view more prices on the order book. \n "

        "answer": "Binance offers different order types for you to use in Spot Trading. You can use them to set your trading strategies and trade efficiently. Let’s look at the common order types in Binance Spot Trading. \n A market order lets you instantly place buy or sell orders for an asset at the best current market price available.  \n You can select [Amount] or [Total] to place a buy or sell market order. For example, you can enter the amount directly if you want to buy a certain quantity of BTC. But if you want to buy BTC with a certain amount of funds, such as 10,000 USDT, you can use [Total] to place the buy order. \n For more information on how to place a market order, please refer to What is Market Order and How to Place It. \n A limit order is an order that you place on the order book with a specific limit price. It will not be executed immediately like a market order. Instead, the limit order will only be executed if the market price reaches your limit price (or better). Therefore, you may use limit orders to buy at a lower price or sell at a higher price than the current market price. \n For example, you place a buy limit order for 1 BTC at $60,000, and the current BTC price is 50,000. Your limit order will be filled immediately at $50,000, as it is a better price than the one you set ($60,000). \n Similarly, if you place a sell limit order for 1 BTC at $40,000 and the current BTC price is $50,000. The order will be filled immediately at $50,000 because it is a better price than $40,000. \n To learn more about limit orders, please refer to What Is a Limit Order?. \n A stop-limit order has a stop price and a limit price. You can set the minimum amount of profit you’re happy to take or the maximum you’re willing to spend or lose on a trade. A limit order will be placed automatically when the trigger price is reached. \n Stop-limit orders are good tools for limiting the losses that may incur in a trade. For example, BTC is trading at $40,000, and you set up a stop-limit order at a stop price of $39,500 and a limit price of $39,000. A limit order at $39,000 will be placed when the price drops from $40,000 to $39,500. \n To learn more about stop-limit orders, please refer to What Is a Stop-Limit Order?. \n A One Cancels the Other (OCO) order combines a limit and stop-limit order. You place two orders simultaneously, but as soon as one is triggered, the other order is canceled. Therefore, only one of the orders can be executed. \n For example, BTC is at $40,000. You can use an OCO order to buy 1 BTC when the price reaches $39,000 or sell it when the price rises to $41,000. One of the orders will be executed first, meaning the second one is automatically canceled. \n To learn more about OCO orders, please refer to What Is an OCO Order? \n A trailing stop order lets you place a pre-set order at a specific percentage away from the market price. It is especially useful when the market swings, which can help you limit the loss and protect gains when a trade does not move in a favorable direction. \n Please note that the trailing stop order does not move back in the other direction. When the price moves in the opposite direction by a specified percentage, it will close or exit the trade at market price. \n For more information on how to place a trailing stop order, please refer to How to Use Spot Trailing Stop Order. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is a market order?",
        "answer": "There are two main types of orders when trading cryptocurrencies: market orders and limit orders. A market order is an instruction to buy or sell an asset immediately (at the market’s current price), while a limit order is an instruction to wait until the price hits a specific or better price before being executed. Let’s see how they work and how to place them on Binance. \n A market order is executed at the current market price as quickly as possible when a user places the order. \n When placing a market order, you can select [Amount] or [Total] to buy or sell.  \n For example, [Amount] is recommended when you want to buy or sell BTC with a certain quantity. However, if you wish to buy BTC with a certain amount of funds, such as 10,000 USDT, placing a market order with [Total] is a better option. \n In general, you can use both functions to place your buy and sell orders. However, when you place the order after the system calculates the amount you can get, the asset price might have changed significantly, and the assets you will receive might be slightly different than the calculated amount before the order is placed. Under some circumstances, the order would fail. This often occurs when the buy/sell ratio is close to or equal to 100%.  \n The current price is 2,400. If you place a market order, your order will be filled with the best available price on the order book immediately. The average filled price of your order may not be exactly 2,400 (A); it could be slightly below or above 2,400.  \n 1. By Total \n Suppose you own 1,000 USDT and want to place a market order for BTC/USDT. When you place a “Buy 100%” order, the system will execute your order at the current market price according to the amount of USDT you have, but it is uncertain how many BTC you can buy. The final BTC transaction amount is determined by the market price and quantity when the order is placed. You can check the amount of BTC purchased and the average price from [Order History]. \n  \n 2. By Amount \n For example, you own 10,000 USDT, and the price of BTC/USDT fluctuates around 23,310.94 USDT. When you place a “Buy 100%” order, the system will match your order with the best available sell order(s) on the market to determine how many BTC you can buy. \n If the system calculates that you can buy 0.40991 BTC with 10,000 USDT and you input 0.40991 BTC and click [Buy BTC], but at the same time, the BTC price increases, then 10,000 USDT can no longer buy 0.40991 BTC and your order will fail. You can place another order by manually editing the BTC amount you wish to purchase., Alternatively, you can use the [Total] function to buy your desired BTC amount.  \n 1. By Amount \n Suppose you own 0.40991 BTC and want to sell 100% with a market order. When you place the order, the amount of USDT from selling 0.40991 BTC will be determined by the current market price. You can check the amount of USDT obtained from the order and the average selling price from [Order History]. \n 2. By Total \n For example, you own 0.40966 BTC, and the price of BTC/USDT is fluctuating around 23310.94 USDT. When you place a “Sell 100%” order, the system will match your order with the best available buy order(s) on the market to determine how much USDT you can obtain. \n If the system calculates that you can sell 0.40966 BTC for 10,000 USDT and you input 10,000 USDT and click to place the sell order, but at the same time BTC price drops, then 0.40966 BTC can no longer sell for 10,000 USDT and your order will fail. You can place another order by manually editing the amount of USDT you wish to receive. Alternatively, you can use [Amount] instead of [Total] to place your market order. \n For a step-by-step tutorial on how to place buy and sell orders on the Binance App, check out our article on How to Spot Trade on Binance App. \n A limit order is an order you place on the order book with a specific limit price. It will only be executed if the market price reaches your limit price (or better). You may use limit orders to buy an asset at a lower price or sell at a higher price than the current market price. \n Buy order \n When you place a buy order with a limit price (C) below the current price (A), and the current price (A) drops to the order’s limit price (C) or below, the order will be executed. When users place a buy order with a limit price(B) above or equal to current price (A), the order will instantly be filled around the current price. \n For example, the current price is 2,400 (A). If you place a buy limit order with a limit price of 1,500 (C), the order will not be executed until the price drops to 1,500 (C) or below. If you place a buy limit order with a limit price of 3,000 (B), which is above the current price, the order will be filled immediately and the executed price will be around 2,400 but not 3,000. \n Sell order \n When you place a sell order with a limit price(B) above the current price(A) and the current price (A) reaches the order’s limit price (B) or above, the order will be executed. When you place a sell order with a limit price(C) below or equal to the current price(A), the order will be filled immediately around the current price.   \n For example, the current price is 2,400 (A) and you place a sell limit order with a limit price of 3,000 (B). The order will not be executed until the price reaches 3,000 (B) or above. If you place a sell limit order with a limit price of 1,500 (C), which is below the current price, the order would be filled immediately at around 2,400 but not 1,500. \n 1. Click [Trade] - [Spot] and select the trading pair. Go to the [Spot] box and click [Buy] - [Limit].  \n 2. Enter the price you want to buy. For example, you want to buy BTC at 24,3363.08 USDT.  \n 3. You can enter the amount of BTC to buy directly next to [Amount].  \n Alternatively, drag the bar above [Total] to customize the percentage of the Spot Wallet balance to use for the order. For example, you own 10,000 USDT and you want to use 100% of it to buy BTC. Drag the bar to 100% and the system will automatically calculate the amount of BTC you can get with the limit order. \n 4. Click [Buy BTC] to place the limit buy order. Once the market price reaches your limit price (or better), your limit order will be executed. \n  \n 1. Click [Trade] - [Spot] and select the trading pair. Go to the [Spot] box and click [Sell] - [Limit].  \n 2. Enter the price you want to sell. For example, you want to sell BTC at 24,363.08 USDT.  \n 3. You can enter the amount of BTC to sell directly next to [Amount].  \n Alternatively, drag the bar above [Total] to customize the percentage of BTC to sell. For example, you own 0.41045 BTC and you want to sell 100% of it. Drag the bar to 100% and the system will automatically calculate the amount of USDT you can get with the limit order. \n 4. Click [Sell BTC] to place the sell limit order. Once the market price reaches your limit price (or better), your limit order will be executed. \n For a step-by-step tutorial on how to place buy and sell limit orders on the Binance App, please refer to the How to Spot Trade on Binance App article. \n If you are using the Binance Website: \n You can view your open orders under [Open Orders]. To cancel an order, click on the bin icon next to it.  \n You can check your filled orders under [Trade History]. \n If you are using the Binance App: \n Go to [Trade] - [Spot], and click the page icon next to the [Funds] tab. You can check your open order under the [Open Orders] tab and your filled orders under [Trades History].  \n "

Once the limit price is reached, the limit order will be executed.  \n You can set the stop price and limit price at the same price. However, it’s recommended that the stop price for sell orders should be slightly higher than the limit price. This price difference will allow for a safety gap in price between the time the order is triggered and when it is fulfilled. You can set the stop price slightly lower than the limit price for buy orders. This will also reduce the risk of your order not being fulfilled. \n Please note that your order will be executed as a limit order after the market price reaches your limit price. If you set the stop-loss limit too high or the take-profit limit too low, your order may never be filled because the market price can’t reach the set limit price. \n The current price is 2,400 (A). You can set the stop price above the current price, such as 3,000 (B), or below the current price, such as 1,500 (C).

Both orders must be either buy or sell orders. If you cancel one of the orders, the entire OCO order pair will be canceled. \n For more details, please refer to our Binance Academy article What Is an OCO Order?. \n Suppose BNB is trading between 510 USDT and its resistance price of 540 USDT. You would like to buy BNB if the price drops to 500 USDT or rises above 540 USDT. \n You can create an OCO order with a limit order of 500 USDT ([Price] on the chart) and a stop-limit order with a stop (trigger) price of 540 USDT. You can then set the stop-limit order’s limit price to 550 USDT, so the order will likely be filled.    \n When BNB reaches 500 USDT, the limit order will be filled. This means the stop-limit order will be automatically canceled. Similarly, when BNB reaches 540 USDT, the stop-limit order will be triggered and the limit order will be automatically canceled. \n For buy orders, you should set the stop price (B) above the current price and the price (C) below the current price. \n For example, the stop-limit order will be triggered when the price goes up to 3,000 (B), and the limit order will be simultaneously canceled. A limit order with limit price (B1) will be placed into the orderbook. However, if the price drops to 1,500 (C) or below, the limit order will be executed automatically with 1,500 (C) and the stop-limit order will be canceled.  \n For sell orders, you can set the stop price (C) below the current price and the price (B) above the current price. \n For example, the stop-limit order will be triggered when the price drops to 1,500 (C), and the limit order will be simultaneously canceled. The limit order with price C1 will then be placed into the orderbook. Otherwise, if the price goes up to 3,000 (B) or above, the limit order will be executed automatically with 3,000 (B) and the stop-limit order will be canceled.  \n 1.

        "answer_tittle": "What is a Spot Trailing Stop Order?",
        "answer": "Tutorial Video \n A trailing stop order is very similar to a stop-limit order, but a trailing stop order’s trigger price will follow your position when the market moves favorably, and will close the position if the market moves adversely against you. With a spot trailing stop order, you can place a pre-set order at a specific percentage away from the market price. \n When the price moves favorably, a trailing stop order locks in profit by enabling a trade to remain open and continue to profit as long as the price moves in the favorable direction. The trailing stop does not move back in the other direction. When the price moves in the opposite direction by a specified percentage, the trailing stop order will be executed as a limit order. When a trade does not move in the favorable direction, a trailing stop order can help you minimize losses and protect gains. \n For a long trade, the selling price is supposed to be higher than the last price. When the price goes up, the trailing price moves up along with the last price and keeps a certain percentage interval. However, the trailing price will stop following if the price drops. A limit sell order will be placed on the order book if the price moves more than the predetermined trailing delta from its highest price and reaches the trailing price. \n A ”buy trailing stop order is the opposite of a “sell” trailing stop order. \n For a short trade, the buy price is supposed to be lower than the last price. When the price drops, the trailing price moves downward with the last price and keeps a certain percentage interval. However, the trailing price will stop following if the price goes up. A limit buy order will be placed on the order book if the price moves more than the predetermined trailing delta from its lowest price and reaches the trailing price. \n Note: Activation price and trailing delta must be fulfilled to activate a limit order to close the trade. \n (1) Placing a sell Trailing Stop Order for a long trade \n The market price of BTCUSDT is 8,500 USDT and you place a trailing stop order with the following parameters: \n The trailing price is 8,075 USDT and the last price is 8,500 USDT. The trailing price will reach 15,200 USDT [Last Price* (1 - trailing delta)] when the price increases to 16,000 USDT. \n The trailing price will stop when the price moves down. When the price moves to its peak price at 18,000 USDT, the trailing price reaches 17,100 USDT. When the price moves down, the trailing stop price stops again. When the price moves down by more than 5%, reaching or exceeding the trailing price of 17,100 USDT, a sell order (8,600 USDT) will be issued to the order book. \n  \n Note: \n Since the market price is 17,100, the sell order (8,600 USDT) will be filled immediately. The final sell price will be much higher than the limit price with an 8,500 USDT profit. However, if you used a stop-limit order with the same parameters (stop price: 8,500 USDT, limit price: 8,600 USDT), the order will be filled immediately at 8,600 USDT. In comparison, trailing stop orders can maximize your revenue. \n (2) Placing a buy Trailing Stop Order for a short trade \n The market price of BTCUSDT is 9,000 USDT and you place a trailing stop order with the following parameters: \n The trailing stop price is 9,450 USDT and the last price is 9,000 USDT. The trailing price reaches 8,925 USDT [Last Price* (1 + trailing delta)] when the price drops to 8,500 USDT. \n The trailing price will stop when the price rises. When the price moves to its lowest price at 8,000 USDT, the trailing price will be 8,400 USDT. When the price rises, the trailing price stops again. When the price moves up by more than 5%, reaching or exceeding the trailing price of 8,400 USDT, a buy order (8,900 USDT) will be issued to the order book. \n 1. Spot Trailing Stop Order uses trailing delta to represent the specific percentage of movement in the opposite direction that you are willing to tolerate. In contrast, Future Trailing Stop Order uses callback rate.2. The spot trailing delta’s range is within 0.1% - 20.0%, while the future’s callback rate range is only within 0.1% - 5.0% (Please refer to the actual limit range on the trading page).3. When trigger conditions are fulfilled, Spot Trailing Stop Order will be executed as a limit order, and Future Trailing Stop Order will be executed as a market order. Therefore, a limit price is required to place a Spot Trailing Stop Order. \n 1. Spot Trailing Stop Order uses trailing delta to represent the specific percentage of movement in the opposite direction that you are willing to tolerate. In contrast, Future Trailing Stop Order uses callback rate. \n 2. The spot trailing delta’s range is within 0.1% - 20.0%, while the future’s callback rate range is only within 0.1% - 5.0% (Please refer to the actual limit range on the trading page). \n 3. When trigger conditions are fulfilled, Spot Trailing Stop Order will be executed as a limit order, and Future Trailing Stop Order will be executed as a market order. Therefore, a limit price is required to place a Spot Trailing Stop Order. \n There are two conditions to activate a trailing stop order. \n A buy trailing stop order will be triggered if: \n A sell trailing stop order will be triggered if:  \n Activation price is your desired price level that triggers the trailing stop. If no activation price is set, the activation price will be the market price by default. \n To place a buy trailing stop order, the activation price must be lower than the market price. Conversely, the activation price must be higher than the market price to place a sell trailing order. \n The markets highest/lowest price must reach or exceed the activation price in order to meet the condition. \n Trailing Delta is the percentage of movement in the opposite direction you are willing to tolerate. The Trailing Delta ranges from 0.1% to 20.0% by placing the rate manually in the “Trailing Delta” field. Alternatively, options such as “1%” or “2%” are available for quick selection. \n The limit price determines the order price submitted to the market after the trailing stop order is executed as a limit order. You can set your desired limit price. \n  \n Important Notes: \n 1. What is the difference between a stop limit order and a trailing stop order? \n A trailing stop order has a variable stop price that can be set at a certain percentage or amount away from the current market price. It aims to protect gains as the order can continue to profit as long as the price is moving in a favorable direction. When the market price hits the stop price in the opposite direction, the system will automatically place a limit order at the limit price the user set to close the order. \n 2. How to calculate the trailing stop price? \n 3. What is the activation price?Similar to a stop-limit order, the activation price is the price at which the trailing stop order is activated. After the stop price is reached, the trailing delta will be active. Once the delta is reached, it will place a limit order on the order book with the limit price you set.  \n For example, user A places a BNBBUSD trailing stop order with the following parameters:  \n To activate the 0.5% trailing delta, the market price must first reach the activation price. When BNB reaches 280 BUSD, the trailing order will be activated and a limit order of 300 BUSD will be placed on the order book. \n 4. Why wasn’t my limit order filled after the trailing stop order conditions were triggered? Please note that there is no guarantee that your limit order will be executed. If the market price does not reach the limit price, your trade will remain unfilled on the order book. \n It also depends on the market condition for your limit order to be filled. If the market price fluctuates rapidly within a short period, the limit order may not be filled as there were not enough counterparty orders to match your order. Please note that the orders on the order book are filled in chronological order.  \n 5. How can I check if the order is activated/triggered? \n You can check the order status under [Open Orders]. \n If you are using the Binance App: \n The order conditions will remain unchanged if it isnt activated.  \n When an order is triggered, a green tick will appear beside [Conditions]. To see if your order is activated or submitted to the order book, tap [Conditions] and a pop-up window with timestamps will appear.    \n If your order status is [Activated], the limit order is not submitted into the order book yet.  \n If your order status is [Submitted], it means your order is activated, and your limit order is submitted on the order book.  \n  \n If you are using the Binance website: \n You can check your open order(s) by clicking on the order’s status.  \n If your order is activated, but not yet triggered, the order status will be displayed as [Activated]. To see the time of activation, simply click on [Activated].  \n If your order is triggered, the order status will be displayed as [Submitted]. You can check when your order was activated and submitted to the order book by clicking on [Submitted]. \n 6. How can I check the activate/trigger time if the order is filled? \n To check the activation or trigger time, go to [Order History] - [Order Detail]. Youll then see your orders activation and submission time under [Time Activated] and [Time Submitted].  \n "

        "answer": "When you place an order on Binance.com, you can select from an array of order types to fulfill your different needs.  \n When placing a limit order, you can check the [Post Only] box and your order will not be executed immediately in the market. It will exist as a maker order on the order book, but never match with orders that are already on the book. Maker orders add liquidity to the market. You will only be charged a maker fee, not a taker fee, when your placed order is executed. \n However, if you want to execute part of the order immediately, for example, you want to buy an asset at a price above the current market price, the system will automatically cancel your order upon the order placement. \n Time in force indicates how long your order will remain active before it is executed or expired. This allows you to be more specific about the time parameters, and you can customize the time when you place an order.  \n  At Binance, you can place GTC (Good-Till-Cancel), IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel), or FOK (Fill-Or-Kill) orders: \n Iceberg orders are large orders split up into a series of small limit orders. Typically, they are placed in this way to avoid disrupting the market with a single large order. Iceberg orders consist of visible and hidden orders, only a small portion of it is displayed on the order book. When the visible orders are executed, the hidden orders will then transition to the order book.  \n Iceberg order will split the original order into several orders on the orderbook, only after the current one is completed, the next one will be placed. The number of icebergs = Order Amount / Iceberg Amount (cannot be higher than 10). \n For example, you wish to sell 1,000 BNB with limit order, you can place your order by checking the [Iceberg] button. Fill in the total amount you want to sell and your order will be divided into small orders (e.g. 100 BNB per order). After the initial order is filled, the other orders will be executed progressively.  \n  \n "

For more details, please visit Benefits of BNB. \n To use BNB to pay for trading fees and get a 25% discount, you must have BNB in your Spot Wallet and enable the [Using BNB Deduction] function first. \n There are several ways to enable or disable the [Using BNB Deduction] function. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and go to [Profile] - [Dashboard]. Scroll down to [More Service] - [Trading fees] to toggle on or off the button next to [Using BNB Deduction (25% discount)]. \n 2. You can enable or disable the function from the Spot and Futures trading pages too. Click [Fee Level] and toggle it on or off. \n 3. You can also enable or disable the function by visiting the Fees & Transactions Overview page. Toggle on and off the button under [BNB Discount] to enjoy a 25% discount on spot trading fees.* \n 1. Log in to your Binance App and go to [All]. Tap the arrow next to your nickname. \n 2. Tap your VIP status. Toggle on or off the button next to [Use BNB to pay fees] to enjoy a 25% discount on Spot and Margin trading fees. \n Please note that if an assets price is less than 0.00000001 BNB, it is not eligible for the BNB fee discount. For example, if X token’s price is 0.000000001 BNB (< 0.00000001 BNB), X token cannot enjoy any BNB fee discount. Only when the conversion ratio is greater than 0.00000001 BNB, you can enjoy the BNB trading fee discount. \n *To celebrate Binance’s fifth anniversary and to thank users for their continued support, Binance extended the option for users to receive a 25% discount on trading fees when paying by BNB. The 25% discount will now be valid until further notice. To learn more, please refer to Binance to Extend the 25% Trading Fee Discount When Using BNB. \n 1. How do I calculate the fees for trading BNB? \n By enabling the [Using BNB Deduction] setting, you can enjoy a discounted trading fee. If this setting is disabled, Binance will apply the full (100%) trading fees. Please refer to the Fees & Transactions Overview page for more details on trading, interest rate, and deposit/withdrawal fees. \n Please note that trading fees are usually charged in the cryptocurrency you receive as a result of the trade and subsequently converted into BNB. \n For example, youre a regular user and you place an order to buy 10 ETH at 3,452.55 USDT each. \n Conversely, if you place an order to sell 10 ETH at 3,452.55 USDT each. \n Please make sure that you maintain a sufficient BNB balance in your account to pay for your trading fees. \n 2. How does the system convert the original fee to BNB? \n When you trade BNB to receive ETH, the system will calculate the fee based on the exchange ratio of ETH to BNB, based on the market price of ETH/BTC and BNB/BTC. \n Exchange ratio of ETH/BNB = ETH/BTC[market price] / (BNB/BTC[market price]). \n Please note that Binance updates its market price when your trade(s) are filled. You can check the Trade History page for the final fees charged. \n 3. I’ve enabled [Using BNB Deduction]. Why am I still being charged the original fee? \n *Please note that the [Est. Fee] displayed is for reference only. The actual transaction fee depends on the final amount of assets you receive from the executed trade. \n In addition, you can use BNB to pay for interest in the Margin account.

        "answer": "You can easily view your Spot Wallet activities, including activity history, asset balance, and today’s PnL, from the Binance website and App.  \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and go to [Wallet] - [Fiat and Spot]. \n 2. You can view all your fiat and crypto assets and their respective balance. You can also buy, deposit, convert, trade, and withdraw them under [Action]. \n Please note that the assets are ranked according to the value of your holdings, calculated based on the latest market price. You can sort the assets by clicking the arrows next to each field. \n 3. You can view all the crypto in your Spot Wallet. Click the asset and it’ll open up a panel on the right. For more details, please refer to How to View Single Token PNL Analysis on Binance Spot. \n Please note:  \n 1. Log in to your Binance App and go to [Wallets] - [Spot]. Here you can view all the crypto assets you hold and their respective balance, ranked from high to low based on the latest market price. \n *Please note that the valuation displayed on your Spot Wallet does not represent the actual value of the asset you hold.  \n 2. Tap on a specific crypto to view details on the asset. \n  \n 1. Why doesn’t the Spot Wallet value estimation match the market price?  \n The fiat value displayed on the Spot Wallet is an estimation for your reference only. It is calculated by first converting the coin’s value to BTC, then converting the BTC value to fiat. Due to the difference in the exchange rate and market price, the value estimation shown might not reflect your actual asset value. Do not evaluate the balance of your wallet using the valuation in fiat currency. Instead, please use the total amount of your coin. For example, if you have 0.5 BNB, you have 0.5 BNB regardless of the valuation in fiat. \n 2. Why does [Today’s PnL] differ from my actual profit & loss?  \n There are many different ways to calculate profit and loss. The method you use may differ from the formula Binance uses.  For more details, hover over the [Information] icon next to [Today’s PNL].  \n Alternatively, you can manually calculate your profit and loss by downloading your Spot Wallet history. \n 3. Why are some transaction records missing from my wallet history?  \n Some products’ transaction records, such as Dual Investment and Simple Earn Locked Products, are still being updated, so you may not be able to view them directly on the [History] page. You can generate a transaction statement to view your transaction details.  \n 4. Why can’t I view transaction history older than 6 months?  \n For security reasons, you can only view up to 6 months of transaction records and enquire about no more than 3 months’ records in a single query. To view older transaction history, please refer to How to Use Binance Account Statements. \n 5. How do I export all sales records for tax filing?  \n Please refer to How to Obtain Tax Reporting on Binance & Frequently Asked Questions. \n 6. How can I see a breakdown of the currencies I own?  \n You can use the Account Statement function to generate a snapshot of your account across your Binance wallets and export it as a JPEG image/PDF file, or send it to your registered email address. Please refer to How to Use Binance Account Statements. \n 7. Why is my equity value so low?  \n This estimated equity value is first converted to BTC and then to USDT (or any fiat currency you have chosen in the settings).  \n Due to the difference in the exchange rate and market price, the value estimation shown might not reflect your actual asset value. Do not evaluate the balance of your wallet using the valuation in fiat currency. Instead, please use the total amount of your coin. For example, if you have 0.5 BNB, you have 0.5 BNB regardless of the valuation in fiat. \n "

        "answer": "You can trade in Isolated Margin and Cross Margin modes on Binance Margin. With the Isolated Margin mode, you can allocate a specific amount of margin to a single position to limit risks. In contrast, the Cross Margin mode uses the balance of your entire Margin Account as collateral, providing you with greater flexibility and lower margin requirements. You can trade with either one based on your risk tolerance and trading strategy.  \n Margin in the Isolated Margin mode is independent for each trading pair. You can open multiple Isolated Margin accounts for different trading pairs. Please note that you can only transfer, hold, and borrow the specified crypto to each Isolated Margin account. For example, you can only transfer and use BTC and USDT in the BTCUSDT Isolated Margin account. \n Each trading pair’s position is independent. If you need to add margin to a position, you must add it to the pair’s respective Isolated Margin account. The system won’t automatically use the margin in your other Isolated Margin accounts.  \n Margin level and risks are also independent for each Isolated Margin account. If liquidation happens to an Isolated Margin position, it won’t affect your other Isolated Margin positions.  \n For more details about Isolated Margin trading, please refer to Binance Isolated Margin Trading Guide. \n Margin in the Cross Margin mode is shared among your Cross Margin positions. You can only open 1 Cross Margin account. It’ll allow you to access all the available trading pairs on Binance Margin. \n Margin level is calculated according to the total asset value and debt in the Cross Margin account. The system will check the margin level of your Cross Margin account and notify you if you need to add more margin or close a position.  \n For more details about Cross Margin trading, please refer to Binance Cross Margin Trading Guide. \n On Day N, ETH is at 2,000 USDT and BCH is also at 2,000 USDT. User A and User B transferred 4,000 USDT into their Margin accounts respectively as margin, and purchased ETH and BCH with 3X leverage on average.

        "answer": "Using Tiered Leverage, the system automatically adjusts the maximum leverage based on the user’s borrowed fund amount. This means that the leverage for an Isolated trading pair is dynamic. So, the corresponding initial risk ratio will vary. With Tiered Leverage, there are 10 tiers for 10x Isolated Margin and 5 tiers for 5x and 3x. The same margin call and liquidation risk ratios will apply to all tiers under the same leverage level on Isolated Margin trading pairs, as shown in the tables below. \n Using BTC/USDT as an example, assume the Tiered Leverage as shown in the following table: \n When the Margin Level hits the liquidation risk ratio, it will trigger liquidation. Your position will be partially liquidated and liquidation will stop when the Margin Level reaches the Margin Call Ratio. In extreme cases, all positions will be liquidated. \n For example, User A borrows 250,000 USDT in the BTCUSDT Isolated Margin account that supports up to 10x leverage. The Margin Call Ratio is 1.1 and the Liquidation Risk Ratio is 1.05. When the Margin Level ≤ 1.05, User A’s collateral assets will be liquidated to pay back the outstanding loan amount and interest. In most cases, the liquidation process will stop when the Margin Level is restored to 1.1 (Margin Call Ratio) or higher. \n You can view the maximum leverage for Isolated Margin from [Wallet] - [Margin] - [Isolated]. \n Alternatively, you may view the tier information on the Borrow/Repay pop-up. \n For more details, please visit Isolated Margin Tier Data. \n  \n "

        "answer": "Binance is gradually enhancing the Margin trading interface and expanding its availability to a larger user base in order to improve the overall user experience. \n Binance Isolated Margin now supports the leverage adjustment function. You can adjust the leverage level on all isolated trading pairs based on your need. \n 1. Log in to your Binance App and tap [Trade] - [Margin]. Choose [Isolated] and tap the leverage ratio icon. You’ll see that it’s disabled by default. Toggle on the button next to it to enable the function.  \n 2. Once you turn on the leverage ratio adjustment switch, you can adjust the leverage multiplier. The maximum borrowing limit is based on the corresponding level of the leverage multiplier you selected.  \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and go to [Trade] - [Margin]. \n 2. Under the Isolated Mode, the leverage ratio adjustment is disabled by default. You can enable it anytime.  \n Please note that if the leverage multiplier is in the middle of two tiers, it will follow the lower tier limit. \n For example, when you select 10x for Isolated BTC/USDT, your quote and base asset tier limit will be 90,000 USDT and 7.2 BTC.  \n When you select 8.5x, your max limit will be a Tier 2 limit of 180,000 USDT and 14.4 BTC, assuming you have enough collateral. \n When the leverage adjustment function is off, the system will automatically calculate the maximum amount you can borrow based on the asset in your Isolated Margin account (current logic) following this formula:  \n (totalAssetInBtc - (Initial Risk Ratio*borrowedInBtc)) / (Initial Risk Ratio-1) / P \n Notes: \n For example, if you’re trading on Isolated BTC/USDT and the current BTC price is 25,000 USDT. And you hold 2 BTC as collateral, with no debt. the maximum USDT borrow amount is: \n = (2 - (1.1572 * 0)) / (1.1572 - 1) / 1/25,000 \n = 2 / 0.1572 / 0.00004 \n = 318,066.15 USDT \n When the leverage adjustment function is on, the system will calculate the available borrowing amount based on formula below: \n Max borrow = MIN { [net assets * (leverage multiplier - 1) - liability 1] / P, (Tier limit - liability 2)} \n Notes:  \n For example, if you hold 2 BTC as collateral, don’t have debt, and selected 9x leverage for Isolated BTC/USDT, the maximum USDT borrow amount is: \n = MIN {[2 * (9 - 1) - 0] / (1/25,000), (210,000 - 0)} \n = MIN (400,000), (90,000) \n Max USDT borrowing amount = 90,000 \n  \n You can refer to the Isolated Margin Tier Data page to learn more about Isolated Margin Pairs data. \n "

        "answer": "Last updated: 2023-08-01 \n Effective from 2023-03-01 06:00(UTC+0), Binance Margin’s new dynamic interest rate system ensures interest rates always reflect current market conditions. \n Margin loan interest rates will change every hour based on current market conditions. Binance Margin users will continue to be charged simple interest for their borrowings hourly. The interest accrues at the start of every hour (e.g., 13:00, 14:00, etc.). \n You can check the latest token borrow rates on the Binance Margin Data page and API. Moreover, you can also find the next hours estimated interest rate via the Margin Trading webpage. Corresponding endpoints are available on API too. \n While the interest rate calculations remain the same under the new dynamic interest rate system, it’s important to understand when and how interest is calculated. You can repay your margin borrowings at any time. However, if funds are borrowed for less than an hour, you’ll still be charged for the full hour’s interest. \n The calculation formula: I (interest) = P (borrowed money) * R (hourly interest) * T (in hours) \n For example \n Assuming the hourly interest is 0.001%. User A borrows 1,000 USDT at 13:20 and repays at 14:15.  \n The interest rate calculation is calculated as 1,000 * 0.001% * 2 hours = 0.02 USDT.  \n User A was charged for two hours because interest is charged once for the borrowing between 13:20 to 13:59 and another from 14:00 to 14:15. \n Given interest rates may fluctuate according to market conditions, we advise monitoring the applicable interest rates and margin level closely to avoid potential liquidation due to large interest rate fluctuations and/or interest accrued over time. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "answer": "To determine your maximum borrow and transfer-out amounts (the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from your Cross Margin account), Binance introduced the “Collateral Value”. Certain margin assets may be valued on a discounted basis using a “Collateral Ratio”, a percentage at which the asset is recognized as collateral. The Collateral Ratio is tiered, it may change as the relevant margin asset amount in your Cross Margin account increases. Collateral Value refers to the total value of all assets in your Cross Margin account (in USDT), taking into account the relevant Collateral Ratio (the percentage at which the relevant asset is valued).   \n Please note that the Collateral Value will not impact your Margin Level. It will continue to be calculated based on the total asset value without any haircuts. \n Different assets in your Cross Margin account have different Collateral Ratios. Please click here to view the Collateral Ratios of all eligible margin assets. Binance may, from time to time, change the Collateral Ratio at its sole discretion. \n The below examples demonstrate how the tiered Collateral Ratio affects the calculation of Collateral Value. \n Example 1 \n Scenario 1User A holds 6,000 BTC in their Cross Margin account and the BTC price is 20,000 USDT. \n The Collateral Value is calculated as follows: \n USDT notional = 6,000 * 20,000 = 120,000,000 USDT \n Tier 1 Collateral Ratio (USDT notional < 100,000,000) = 100%  \n Tier 2 Collateral Ratio (USDT notional 100,000,000 > 120,000,000) = 97.5% \n Collateral Value (USDT) = (100,000,000) * 100% + (120,000,000 - 100,000,000) * 97.5% = 119,500,000 USDT \n Example 2 \n Scenario 2 \n User A holds 15,000,000 USDT of Token X. The Collateral Value is calculated as follows: \n USDT notional = 15,000,000 \n Tier 1 Collateral Ratio (USDT notional < 500,000) = 100%  \n Tier 2 Collateral Ratio (USDT notional 500,000 > 1,000,000) = 90% \n Tier 3 Collateral Ratio (USDT notional 1,000,000 > 2,000,000) = 80% \n Tier 4 Collateral Ratio (USDT notional 2,000,000 > 4,000,000) = 60% \n Tier 5 Collateral Ratio (USDT notional 4,000,000 > 7,000,000) = 30% \n Tier 6 Collateral Ratio (USDT notional 7,000,000 > 10,000,000) = 10% \n Tier 7 Collateral Ratio (USDT notional > 10,000,000) = 0% \n Collateral Value (USDT) = 500,000 * 100% + 500,000 * 90% + 1,000,000 * 80% + 2,000,000 * 60% + 3,000,000 * 30% + 3,000,000 * 10% + 5,000,000 * 0% = 4,150,000 USDT \n 1. Will my position get liquidated sooner after factoring in the haircut function? \n No, your Margin Level will not be impacted by your Collateral Value. It will still be calculated based on the full value of your assets without any haircut.  \n 2. Where can I see my maximum borrow and transfer-out amounts? \n You can check the maximum borrow amount on the trading page and the max transfer-out amount on the transfer page. \n 3. Does the Collateral Ratio apply to both Cross and Isolated Margin? \n The Collateral Ratio only applies to Cross Margin. Isolated Margin will not be affected. \n 4. How will this affect the Portfolio Margin Program? \n Binance Portfolio Margin Program users will not be affected by the changes in Collateral Ratios for Cross Margin accounts. Portfolio margin users will still follow the existing haircut rules applicable to the Portfolio Margin Program. Please refer to the Portfolio Margin Collateral Ratio table for more details. \n 5. Can I check the new maximum borrow and transfer amounts via API? \n Yes, you can check the limits via API. \n "

These trades are taking volume off of the order book, and therefore called the taker. \n When you place an order that goes on the order book partially or fully, such as a limit order, any subsequent trades coming from that order will be as a “maker.” \n These orders add volume to the order book, helping to make the market, and are therefore termed the maker for any subsequent trades. \n Commission Fee = Notional Value * Fee Rate \n Notional Value = (Number of Contracts* Contract Size) / Trade Price \n For example, a regular users maker commission: 0.01%; taker commission: 0.05% \n Buy 10 BTCUSD 0925 quarterly contracts using market order: \n Notional Value = (Number of Contracts * Contract Size) / Opening Price \n = (10 contracts * 100 USD) / 10,104 USD \n = 0.09897 BTC \n Taker commission fee: 0.09897 * 0.050% = 0.000049485 BTC \n After the price increases, sell 10 BTCUSD 0925 quarterly contracts using limit order: \n Notional Value = (Number of Contracts * Contract Size) / Closing Price \n = (10 contracts * 100 USD) / 11,104 USD \n = 0.09 BTC \n Maker commission fee: 0.09 * 0.01% = 0.000009 BTC \n Commission Fee = Notional Value * Fee Rate \n Notional value = number of contracts x trade price \n For example, VIP0 marker commission: 0.02%; taker commission: 0.040% \n Buy 1 BTC BTCUSDT contract using Market order: \n Notional value = number of contracts x opening price \n = 1 BTC * 10,104 \n = 10,104 \n Taker commission fee is paid: 10,104 * 0.040% = 4.0416 USDT \n After the price rises, Sell 1 BTC BTCUSDT contract using Limit order: \n Notional Value = Number of Contracts * Closing Price \n = 1 BTC * 11,104 \n = 11,104 \n Maker commission fee is paid: 11,104 * 0.02% = 2.2208 USDT \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is Crypto Futures Trading?",
        "answer": "Crypto futures are contracts that represent the value of a specific cryptocurrency. You do not own the underlying cryptocurrency when you purchase a futures contract. Instead, you own a contract under which you have agreed to buy or sell a specific cryptocurrency at a later date. \n  \n In the spot market, you buy and sell cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum for immediate delivery. In other words, cryptocurrencies are directly transferred between market participants (buyers and sellers). In a spot market, you have direct ownership of cryptocurrencies and are entitled to economic benefits, such as voting for major forks or staking participation.  \n  \n 1. Leverage - Leverage makes futures trading extremely capital-efficient. With a futures contract, you can open a 1 BTC futures position at a fraction of its market value. Spot trading, on the other hand, does not provide leverage. For example, to purchase 1 BTC in the spot market, you would need thousands of dollars. Assuming you only have 10,000 USDT available, you could only afford to buy 10,000 USDT worth of Bitcoin in this case. \n 2. Flexibility to Long or Short - If you hold cryptocurrencies in the spot market, you may benefit from capital appreciation as the value of your cryptocurrency rises over time. Futures contracts, on the other hand, allow you to profit from short-term price movements in either direction. Even if the price of Bitcoin falls, you can participate in the downtrend and profit as prices continue to drift lower. Futures contracts can also be used to protect against unexpected risks and extreme price volatility, making them ideal for miners and long-term investors.  \n 3. Liquidity - With trillions of dollars in monthly volume, the crypto futures markets provide deep liquidity. For example, the Bitcoin futures market has an average monthly turnover of $2 trillion, surpassing trading volumes in Bitcoin spot markets. Its robust liquidity promotes price discovery and allows traders to transact in the market quickly and efficiently.  \n 4. Futures vs. Spot prices - Cryptocurrency prices are determined by buyers and sellers through an economic process of supply and demand. The spot price is the ruling price for all transactions in the spot market. The futures price, on the other hand, is based on the prevailing spot price plus the futures premium. The futures premium could be either positive or negative. A positive premium indicates that the futures price is higher than the spot price; conversely, a negative premium indicates that the futures price is lower than the spot price. Changes in supply and demand may cause the future premium to fluctuate. \n "

        "url": "introduction-to-binance-futures-funding-rates-360033525031",
        "answer_tittle": "1. What is the Funding Rate?",
        "answer": "Funding rates are periodical cash flows exchanged between long- and short-position holders. The absolute amount per lot will be based on the difference between the perpetual Futures and index prices. When the market is bullish, the funding rate is usually positive. Traders with long positions will pay traders on the short side. Conversely, the funding rate will usually be negative when the market is bearish, and traders with short positions will pay traders on the long side. \n Please note that Binance only helps facilitate the exchange of funding amounts between long- and short-position holders. Binance does not charge any service fees. \n Unlike traditional Futures, perpetual Futures contracts have no expiration date. Traders can hold their positions perpetually unless they are liquidated. To ensure perpetual contracts’ prices correspond to their underlying markets, crypto exchanges created a mechanism known as Funding Rate. \n The funding rate primarily helps perpetual contracts’ prices converge to the underlying assets price. With sufficient liquidity, trading perpetual contracts are very similar to trading in the spot market. \n As such, crypto exchanges created a mechanism to ensure that perpetual contract prices correspond to the index. This is known as the Funding Rate. \n Funding Amounts are calculated using the following formula: \n Funding Amount = Nominal Value of Positions * Funding Rate \n Where  \n Funding payments with a settlement frequency of every eight hours occur at 00:00 (UTC), 08:00 (UTC), and 16:00 (UTC). Funding payments with a settlement frequency of every four hours occur at 00:00 (UTC), 04:00 (UTC), 08:00 (UTC), 12:00 (UTC), 16:00 (UTC), and 20:00 (UTC). \n Starting from 2023-10-12 08:00 (UTC), the Funding Rate settlement frequency of the following USDⓈ-M perpetual contracts will be adjusted (from every eight hours to every four hours): \n Traders are only liable for funding payments in either direction if they have open positions at the pre-specified funding times. You are not liable for any funding if you do not have a position. If you close your position before the funding time, you will not pay or receive any funding. \n There is a 1-minute deviation in the actual funding fee transaction time. For example, when a trader opens a position at 08:00:59 UTC, the funding fee could still apply to the trader (either paying or receiving the funding fee). \n You can view the Funding Rates and the countdown timer to the next funding on the Binance Futures interface above the candlestick chart: \n Please note that the funding rate shown represents an estimation of the last 8 hours of the premium index. For example, from 09:00 UTC, the funding rate calculation uses the premium index dataset from 01:00 UTC to 09:00 UTC (rather than from 08:00 UTC to 09:00 UTC). \n There are two components to the Funding Rate: the Interest Rate and the Premium. Binance uses a flat interest rate, with the assumption that holding cash equivalent returns a higher interest than BTC equivalent.  \n On Binance Futures, the interest rate is fixed at 0.03% daily by default (0.01% per funding interval since funding occurs every 8 hours). Please note that this doesn’t apply to certain contracts, such as BNBUSDT, BNBBUSD and ETHBTC’s interest rates are at 0%.  \n There may be a significant difference in price between the perpetual contract and the Mark Price. On such occasions, a Premium Index will be used to enforce price convergence between the two markets. The Premium Index history can be viewed here. It is calculated separately for every contract: \n Premium Index (P) = [Max(0, Impact Bid Price - Price Index ) - Max(0, Price Index - Impact Ask Price)] / Price Index \n Impact Bid Price = The average fill price to execute the Impact Margin Notional on the Bid Price \n Impact Ask Price = The average fill price to execute the Impact Margin Notional on the Ask Price \n Impact Margin Notional (IMN) = 200 USDT / Initial margin rate at the maximum leverage level \n For example, if the maximum leverage of BNBUSDT perpetual contract is 20x, and its corresponding Initial Margin Rate is 5%, then the Impact Margin Notional (IMN) is 4,000 USDT (200 USDT / 5%), and the system will take an IMN of 4,000 USDT every minute in the order book to measure the average Impact Bid/Ask price. \n For more information, please visit Leverage and Margin of USDⓈ-M Futures. \n You can view the real-time and historical Funding Rates by clicking [Information] - [Funding Rate History]. Alternatively, click here directly. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account. Click [Derivatives] - [USDⓈ-M Futures]. \n 2. Click the manage button to go to [Preference]. \n 3. Go to the [Notification] tab to toggle on the [Funding Fee Trigger] button. You can also customize the Funding Rate charges percentage between 0.0001%~0.75%. Currently, it is defaulted to 0.25%, meaning you will be notified when the expected Funding Rate charges reach 0.25%.  \n Important note: You will be notified via email / in-app notification. This function serves as a risk warning and Binance cannot guarantee timely delivery.

Binance reserves the right and has no obligation to deliver notifications. \n Let’s use the following Bid-side order book for a USDⓈ-Margined contract as an example: \n If multiplier *∑px*qx > IMN in Level x and multiplier * ∑px-1*qx-1 < IMN in Level x-1, then we can find the Impact Bid Price from the Level x order book: \n *IMN: Impact Margin Notional \n To get the Impact Bid/Ask Price Series, the system performs the above methodology over the order book snapshots in this funding period: \n The Ask order book is summarized as below: \n *Assume the maximum leverage of BNBUSDT perpetual contract is 125x and the contract default Impact Margin Notional is 25,000 USDT. \n From the table above, we get the following figures: \n Substituting into the formula: \n Impact Ask Price = IMN / [(IMN-multiplier * ∑px-1 * qx-1)/px+multiplier * ∑qx-1] \n = 25,000 / [(25,000 - 22,704.65) / 279.71 + 81.18] \n = 279.69 USDT \n Analysis: \n Binance calculates the Premium Index every 5 seconds (12 premium index data points in a minute).  \n The number of data points used to calculate the Funding Rate n = 60/5 * 60 * hours of the funding interval \n For example, the Funding Rate is calculated by taking the time-weighted average across all 5,760 premium index data points for the 8-hour funding interval. \n Click to view the Premium Index History. \n Premium Index Formula: \n Premium Index (P) = [ Max(0, Impact Bid Price - Price Index ) - Max(0, Price Index - Impact Ask Price)] / Price Index \n (Max(0,bpn-ipn)-Max(0,ipn-apn))/ipn \n Use the Premium Index Series in this funding period (from step 2), we substitute it to the Average Premium Index formula: \n Average Premium Index (P) = (1*Premium_Index_1 + 2*Premium_Index_2 + 3*Premium_Index_3 +···+ n*Premium_Index_n) / (1+2+3+···+n) \n *Premium Index 1: the first premium index data point \n n = 60/5 * 60 * 8 = 5,760 (Assume the funding interval is 8 hours) \n The Funding Rate is then calculated with this 8-Hour Interest Rate Component and the 8-Hour Premium Component. A +/- 0.05% damper is also added. For example, the Funding Rates calculated from 00:00 - 08:00 are exchanged at 08:00. \n The Funding Rate formula: \n Funding Rate (F) = Average Premium Index (P) + clamp (interest rate - Premium Index (P), 0.05%, -0.05%) \n *Premium Index (P) here refers to the current average \n Note: \n The function clamp (x, min, max) means that if (x < min), then x = min; if (x > max), then x = max; if max ≥ x ≥ min, then return x. \n In other words, as long as the Premium Index is between -0.04% to 0.06%, the Funding Rate will equal 0.01% (the Interest Rate). \n If (Interest Rate (I) - Premium Index (P)) is within +/-0.05%, then F = P + (I - P) = I. In other words, the Funding Rate will equal the Interest Rate. \n Example 1: \n Time stamp: 2020-08-27 20:00:00 UTC \n Price Index: 11,312.66 USDT \n Impact Bid Price: 11,316.83 USDT \n Impact Ask Price: 11,317.66 USDT \n Premium Index(P) = Max(0, Impact Bid Price − Price Index ) − Max(0, Price Index − Impact Ask Price) / Price Index \n =Max(0, 11,316.83 - 11,312.66) - Max(0,11,312.66 - 11317.66) / 11,312.66 \n = (4.17 - 0) / 11,312.66 \n = 0.0369% \n *Please note that this example is within the funding period 16:00 - 24:00 (UTC), the actual Premium Index at 20:00 (UTC) needs to be taken from the time-weighted average across all indices to the 16:00 - 20:00 (UTC) funding period. \n Example 2: \n Time stamp: 2020-08-28 08:00:00 UTC \n Mark Price: 11,329.52 USDT \n This is the end of the funding period 00:00 - 08:00 (UTC), 8 hours = 480 minutes, so the 8-hour weighted average Premium Index (P) = 0.0429% \n Average Premium Index = (1*Premium_Index_1+2*Premium_Index_2+3*Premium_Index_3+···+ n*Premium_index_n)/(1+2+3+···+n) \n Premium_Index_1: the first premium index data point \n Funding Rate (F) = Premium Index (P) + clamp(interest rate - Premium Index (P), 0.05%, -0.05%) \n = 0.0429% + Clamp(0.01% - 0.0429%，0.05%， -0.05%) \n = 0.0429% + (-0.0329%) \n = 0.0100% \n Capped Funding Rate = clamp(Funding Rate, Floor, Cap) \n Effective Date: October 9, 2023 08:30 (UTC) \n The capped funding rate for USDⓈ-M perpetual contracts are categorized based on the maximum leverage associated with the contracts (≥ 30x or ≤ 25x). \n Heres a comprehensive breakdown: \n Example 1:  \n To calculate the Floor and Cap of an ADAUSDT perpetual contract, the corresponding Initial Margin Ratio and Maintenance Margin Ratio in the table at the maximum leverage level 75x are 1.3% and 0.5%, respectively.  \n Example 2: \n The Floor and Cap of a STMXUSDT perpetual contract is ± 3%, as STMXUSDT perpetual contract’s maximum leverage level is 25x and below. \n **In the event of extreme market conditions, Binance reserves the right to adjust the Funding Rate Cap and Floor parameters. \n In the event of extreme market volatility, Binance reserves the right to update the Funding Rate Floor and Cap, as well as the funding interval of a perpetual contract that differs from the default 8-hour funding interval. You can visit the Real-Time Funding Rate and Funding Rate History pages to view the latest funding interval and funding rate Cap/Floor. Please note that funding fees (if any) will be deducted from the available balance in your Futures Wallet. If your wallet balance is insufficient, the funding fees (if any) will be deducted from your position margin, which may affect your liquidation price. Please manage your positions accordingly to avoid any liquidation risks. \n "

        "answer": "Binance uses the Mark Price to avoid unnecessary liquidations and to combat market manipulation. \n To avoid spikes and unnecessary liquidations during periods of high volatility, Binance Futures uses Last Price and Mark Price. \n Last Price refers to the latest transaction price the contract was traded at. In other words, the last trade in trading history defines the Last Price. It’s used for calculating your realized PnL (Profit and Loss). \n On the other hand, Mark Price is calculated using a combination of funding data and a basket of price data from multiple spot exchanges. Your liquidation prices and unrealized PnL are calculated based on the Mark Price. \n Here’s where to switch between the 2 prices on both the Mobile application and the Desktop version: \n Risk and leverage are adjusted based on the user’s absolute exposure; the larger the position, the higher the required margin, and the lower the leverage. A liquidation is triggered when: \n Collateral = Initial Collateral + Realized PnL + Unrealized PnL < Maintenance Margin \n It is important to note that the maintenance margin change will directly affect the liquidation price. To avoid being liquidated (i.e. margin ratio hits 100%), please add more margin or reduce your positions. It is recommended to keep a margin ratio below 80%.  \n Liquidation occurs when the Mark Price hits the liquidation price of a position. Traders are advised to pay close attention to the movements of the Mark Price and the liquidation price to avoid being liquidated. \n In hedge mode, both long and short positions of the same symbol share the same liquidation price in the Cross Margin mode. \n If both long and short positions of the same symbol are in isolated mode, the positions will have two different liquidation prices depending on the margin allocated to the positions. \n Binance allows highly leveraged trading by using a sophisticated risk engine and a liquidation model that might be intricate.  \n To find more about the calculation of Liquidation Price, please refer to: \n How to Calculate Liquidation Price of USDⓈ-M Futures Contracts \n How to Calculate Liquidation Price of COIN-M Futures Contracts \n During the liquidation process, all open orders are immediately canceled. All users will be subjected to the same liquidation protocols referred to as “Smart Liquidation.” Binance avoids full liquidation of a user’s position whenever possible.  \n For any traders that are cleared via forced liquidation and not by an order issued by the user, a liquidation clearance fee will be charged on the amount liquidated only (not the notional value of the position). \n Please note that under normal circumstances, users with smaller position size are highly likely to be fully liquidated when liquidation occurs while users with larger position size are less likely to be fully liquidated. The reason is that the Maintenance Margin is based on a user’s position size and not their leverage selection. As a result, the effective Maintenance Margin is lower than the liquidation clearance fee rate for users with a smaller position size, making them bankrupt when they enter liquidation regardless of the final clearing price. \n Please note that all liquidation orders are Immediate or Cancel orders. The order will fill as much as possible and cancel the rest. This is different from a Fill or Kill order, which will only execute if the order can be completely executed, or otherwise canceled. The remaining positions will either be assigned to the Insurance Fund or used for counterparty liquidation. \n The system will first cancel all open orders, then attempt to reduce the user’s margin limit with one large Immediate or Cancel order without fully liquidating the user. If the user is margin compliant after calculating the realized losses and liquidation clearance fee deductions, the liquidation will stop.  \n If the user is still margin deficient, the user’s position will be closed at the bankruptcy price and the Insurance Fund will take over the position as the user is declared bankrupt. A portion of the remaining collateral (if any) will go to the Insurance Fund. If an account becomes bankrupt (negative wallet balance), the Insurance Fund will balance the account back to 0. \n When a user’s account balance falls into negative equity, Binance will use the Insurance Fund to cover the deficit losses in the user’s account. The automated negative balance clearance will be performed every ten minutes.  \n Please note the negative account balances will be automatically cleared for users who meet all the requirements below:  \n If you do not meet the criteria stated above, please contact our Customer Service agents for assistance. \n When a users position is liquidated, a certain percentage of the Insurance Clearance fee will be collected and contributed to Insurance Fund reserves, marked as Insurance Clearance in the Transaction History. \n It is recommended that users strictly control their position risks to avoid liquidation. \n For more details on the Insurance Clearance fees, please refer to the trading rules page. \n Please note: \n *Disclaimer: The numbers in this article are subject to change without further notice. Please refer to the English version for the most updated numbers. \n  \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What are Insurance Funds?",
        "answer": "Insurance funds are safety nets that protect bankrupt traders from adverse losses and ensure that the profits of winning traders are paid out in full. The primary purpose of an insurance fund is to limit the occurrences of counterparty liquidations. In counterparty liquidations, positions of opposing traders are automatically liquidated to cover for a bankrupt trader’s position. In these situations, opposing profitable positions with high leverage are likely to receive counterparty liquidations. Insurance Funds solve this issue by using the collateral from non-bankrupt users’ fees to cover the losses of bankrupt users (negative balance accounts). \n In cases where a trader in liquidation (defined as collateral < maintenance margin) has less than 0 USDT after all his positions are liquidated, or is otherwise unable to liquidate positions, the trader is bankrupt, and Binance will take over the remaining positions. \n In the majority of these cases, Binance will use the Insurance Fund to take over the positions and offload them onto the market gradually. The Insurance Fund will collect liquidation fees from users that do not result in bankruptcy. If the insurance fund is unable to accept positions from the liquidations, counterparty-liquidation will occur. \n The Insurance Fund will be subjected to the following rules: \n The fund will have a maximum net notional position check. The fund will not be allowed to exceed a predefined position notional on the market; by default, this is 100% the size of the insurance fund. Any position that would increase beyond the max notional will be subjected to counterparty-liquidation. The insurance fund will offload positions according to a preset algorithm. All events that generally require intervention by the insurance fund will go into counterparty-liquidation before the fund can take positions. \n You can access the insurance fund balance (USDT or BUSD) of BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, BTCBUSD, ETHBUSD, and all other futures contracts by clicking [Information] - [Insurance Fund History] on the Binance Futures trading interface. \n Alternatively, you can directly visit [Insurance Fund History]. \n Binance offers USDT-margined and BUSD-margined Futures contracts under USDⓈ-M Futures. The following is the composition of Insurance funds for USDⓈ-M contracts: \n The insurance funds for USDⓈ-M contracts are supported by the Multi-Assets Mode, which means the USDT and BUSD held in the insurance funds are jointly accounted for in the balance calculation. You can find their asset balance from the insurance balance chart. \n  \n "

        "answer": "Video Tutorial \n Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) is the final step taken only when the Insurance Fund cannot accept the bankrupt client’s positions. Binance takes every possible step to avoid auto-deleveraging, and has several features such as Immediate or Cancel Limit Orders to minimize the potential impact of any auto-deleveraging when it does occur. Unfortunately, due to the volatility in the crypto markets, and the high leverage offered to users, it is not possible to fully avoid auto-deleverage liquidations. In order to provide the best possible user experience, we are striving to keep auto-deleveraging liquidations to an absolute minimum. \n As a trader, your position is at risk of auto-deleveraging based on an indicator with your priority in the queue. Below is an example of the indicators, from lowest priority to highest priority. \n When there is an auto-deleverage liquidation, a notice is immediately sent to the affected user.  \n The trader’s position in the priority ranking is calculated by both profit and leverage; the formula is presented at the end of this page. More profitable and higher leveraged traders will be liquidated first. Specifically, traders will be ranked by their margin ratio and unrealized PnL as a percentage of their collateral. The precise rank is known as “LeveragePnL”, which is defined as unrealized PnL/collateral multiplied by the margin ratio. The exact formulation is at the end. \n From there, traders will be ranked by the LeveragePnlQuantile term; traders at imminent risk of being automatically liquidated will see the appropriate indicator in their interface. If the liquidation occurs, the trader will be sent a notice with the amount and liquidation price. The trader’s positions will be closed out at the bankruptcy price of the initial liquidated order. Any open orders will be canceled. Once the liquidation process is completed, the trader will be able to re-enter immediately. \n Note: Bankruptcy price may be out of the contract’s market price range. It is highly recommended that the trader pays attention to the ADL indicator to avoid being deleveraged. \n Pnl Percent = max(0,Unrealized Profit)/max(1,Wallet Balance) \n If (Wallet Balance+Unrealized Profit)≤0, then Margin Ratio = 0 \n If (Wallet Balance+Unrealized Profit)＞0, then Margin Ratio = Maintenance Margin/(Wallet Balance+Unrealized Profit) \n Leverage Pnl = Pnl Percent × Margin Ratio Leverage Pnl = Pnl Percent × Margin Ratio \n Leverage Pnl Quantile = rank(user.Leverage Pnl)/Total User Count \n  \n "

As such, market movements are completely out of your control. \n What you can control instead is risk, and decide how and when you trade, under market conditions that are conducive to your methods and style. \n Responsible trading is about having complete control over your trades and taking responsibility for your actions. Trading responsibly calls for not spending beyond your means. In other words, don’t risk money that you can’t afford to lose. \n Here are some tips and good practices that will help you be a more responsible trader: \n  \n When trading, self-discipline refers to avoiding unhealthy excesses like impulsive trading or gambling. We advocate users trade responsibly and practice self-discipline, especially when they feel pressured by losses or a losing streak. \n Our system-generated notifications constantly remind users of the dangers of impulsive trading and the risk involved when trading more complicated products like derivatives. \n Cryptocurrency trading is a vast subject that may seem overwhelming to novice traders. As such, you need to continuously educate yourself to stay sharp and competitive. \n Binance has worked towards educating its users on every aspect of crypto trading, from the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies to the complexities of crypto-economics. These are freely available on Binance Academy, Binance Research, and Binance Support Pages. \n Risk management is a core component that is key to every trader’s success. It helps you avoid substantial losses that can lead to you losing your entire trading account.  \n On the Binance trading interface, we have established risk management features such as stop-loss orders to help users manage the risk in individual trades. \n Additionally, Binance Futures have also established other safety features such as liquidation mechanisms and insurance funds to protect users from adverse losses.  \n Knowing when to stop, and learning to recognize unhealthy trading habits, calls for being honest with yourself about the risks you take on and the behavior that accompanies it.  \n After losing, for example, do you then keep trading to recoup your losses and risk running up heavier losses in the process?  \n As a responsible trader, you should always keep yourself in check and ensure that you have procedures to avoid compulsive trading disorder. \n Binance has set in place several procedures to remind users and prevent impulsive behavior. For instance, when a user experiences a losing streak or suffers a heavy loss, we continuously remind them of the risk involved in trading and encourage them to hold back on trading activities.  \n "

        "answer_tittle": "Advantages of Coin-Margined contracts",
        "answer": "Binance offers both USDⓈ-Margined Futures and Coin-Margined Futures products. Here are their key characteristics: \n Coin-Margined Futures contracts on Binance offer the following characteristics: \n Meanwhile, USDⓈ-Margined Futures contracts offer the following characteristics: \n Binance’s Coin-margined contracts are denominated and settled in cryptocurrency. For example, to open a position in BTCUSD Quarterly 1225, you can simply fund the initial margin in Bitcoin.  \n If you are a miner or a HODLer, this is ideal for you. As contracts are settled in the underlying cryptocurrency, any profits can contribute to your long-term stack. Furthermore, as prices continue to rise, the value of your collateral will increase correspondingly. This is simply a great way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings over the long run.  \n You can also hedge your positions in the futures market without converting any of the holdings into USDT. As such, you do not need to sell any cryptocurrencies at a compromised price. \n To hedge, simply open a short position in any Binance COIN-margined quarterly futures. If the price of the underlying asset goes down, profits from the futures position can offset your portfolio’s losses.  \n  \n USDⓈ-Margined contracts are linear futures quoted and settled in USDT or BUSD. One of the key benefits of USDT or BUSD settlement is that you can easily calculate your returns in fiat. This makes USDⓈ-Margined contracts more intuitive. For example, when you make 500 BUSD in profit, you can easily estimate that the profit is worth approximately $500 - since the value of 1 BUSD is pegged closely to 1 USD.  \n Additionally, a universal settlement currency, such as BUSD or USDT, provides more flexibility. You can use the same settlement currency across various futures contracts (i.e., BTC, ETH, XRP, etc.). This eliminates the need to buy the underlying coins to fund futures positions. As such, you will not incur excessive fees as there is no additional conversion required when trading with USDT. \n In periods of high volatility, USDⓈ-Margined contracts can help reduce the risk of large price swings. Thus, you do not need to worry about hedging your underlying collateral exposure. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "1. Expiration",
        "answer": "Binance offers futures trading through two flagship products: Perpetual Futures, and Quarterly Futures. Here are the key differences between the two products: \n  \n A quarterly futures contract allows a trader to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price before a specified period. In other words, futures contracts have a limited lifespan and will expire based on their respective calendar cycle. For instance, our BTC 0925 is a quarterly futures contract that will expire 3 months upon the date of issuance.  \n On the other hand, perpetual futures contracts, as the name suggests, do not have an expiration date. Therefore, traders do not need to keep track of various delivery months, unlike quarterly futures contracts. For instance, a trader can keep a short position to perpetuity, unless he gets liquidated. \n  \n Since perpetual futures contracts never settle in the traditional sense, exchanges need a mechanism to ensure that futures prices and index prices converge on a regular basis. This mechanism is also known as Funding Rate/Fees. \n Funding fees are periodic payments either to traders that are long or short based on the difference between perpetual contract markets and spot prices. Therefore, depending on open positions, traders will either pay or receive funding.  \n Unlike perpetual contracts, quarterly contracts do not carry a funding fee. This is favorable to long-term position traders and hedgers as funding fees may fluctuate over time. Especially in extreme market conditions, high funding fees can be costly to maintain a long-term position in the market.  \n For instance, funding fees across BTC perpetual markets may surge as Bitcoin prices rally, this indicates the imbalance of buying pressure in the market. As such, this effect results in long positions becoming more costly to hold over time. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "Profit and Loss calculations for COIN-M Futures contracts (BTCUSD)",
        "answer": "Profit and loss calculations are based on the contract’s collateral. For example, a USDⓈ-margined contract is denominated in USDT, whereas a BTC COIN-margined contract is denominated in BTC.  \n Please note that unrealized profit and loss are calculated based on the Mark Price, while realized profit and loss are calculated based on the Last Price.  \n A BTC COIN-M Futures contract is denominated, collateralized, and settled in Bitcoin, which means Bitcoin is used as the base currency. Each BTC COIN-M contract represents 100 USD and as such, USD is the counter currency. Since each contract represents a fixed quantity of USD, this means BTC is used to fund the Initial Margin or calculate profit and loss.  \n Suppose you purchased 100 BTC-margined perpetual contracts (100 * $100 = $10,000) at $50,000 each. By doing this, you are essentially selling $10,000 and buying an equivalent value of Bitcoin (10,000 / 50,000 = 0.2 BTC). \n Suppose Bitcoin’s price rose to $55,000 and you want to secure profits from the trade. To close the position, you buy back $10,000 worth of contracts and simultaneously sell the equivalent in Bitcoin (10,000 / 55,000 = 0.1818 BTC). \n In this trade, your profit will be calculated as: Quantity of Bitcoins at Entry - Quantity of Bitcoins at Exit = 0.2 - 0.1818 = 0.0182 BTC. \n In short, the profit and loss formula will be: \n ((1 / Futures Entry Price) - (1 / Futures Exit Price)) * Position Size \n ((1/ 50,000) - (1 / 55,000)) * (100 * 100) = 0.0182 BTC \n Example for short position: \n Short BTCUSD 0925 Quarterly (Buy USD, Sell BTC):  \n ((1 / Futures Entry Price) - (1 / Futures Exit Price)) * (Position Size * -1) \n ((1/50,000) - (1/45,500)) * (100 contracts * 100 USD * -1) = 0.0198 BTC \n Suppose you purchase (long) 10,000 USDT worth of BTCUSDT perpetual contracts at 50,000 USDT. The price increases and you exit at 55,000 USDT. Your profit will be: \n ((1 / Futures Entry Price) - (1 / Futures Exit Price)) * Position Size \n ( 1 / 50,000 - 1 / 55,000 ) * 10,000 = 0.018182 BTC \n In USDT, it would be 0.018182 * 55,000 USDT = 1,000 USDT  \n Suppose you sold (short) 10,000 USDT worth of BTCUSDT perpetual contracts at 50,000 USDT. The price decreases and you exit at 45,000 USDT. Your profit will be: \n ((1 / Futures Entry Price) - (1 / Futures Exit Price)) * (Position Size * -1) \n  ( 1 / 50,000 - 1 / 45,000 ) * -10,000 = 0.022 BTC \n In USDT, it would be 0.022 * 45,000 USDT = 1,000 USDT  \n You can use the Mark Price or the Entry Price to calculate the Return on Equity (ROE). Go to the [Positions] tab on the trading interface, click [PnL(ROE%)] and select the desired price basis. \n Unrealized PNL = Position Size * Direction of Order * (Mark Price - Entry Price) \n ROE% = Unrealized PNL in USDT / Entry Margin = ( (Mark Price - Entry Price ) * Direction of Order * Size ) / (position_amount * contract_multiplier * mark_price * IMR) \n *IMR = 1 / Leverage \n Unrealized PNL = Position Size * Direction of Order * (Last Price - Entry Price) \n ROE% = Unrealized PNL in USDT / Entry Margin = ( (Last Price - Entry Price) * Direction of Order * Size) / (position_amount * contract_multiplier * mark_price * IMR) \n Direction of order: 1 for long orders; -1 for short orders \n Unrealized PNL = position_size * contract_multiplier * Direction of Order * (1 / Entry Price - 1 / Mark Price) \n ROE% = Unrealized PNL * price / abs(size) * contract_multiplier * IMR \n Please note that price in the above formula could be the Mark Price or the Entry Price (based on the price basis). \n  \n "

Investors, corporations, and governments use derivatives such as futures contracts to protect their exposure to risk and volatility of asset prices.  \n A derivative is a financial contract that derives its value from an underlying asset. Traditionally, derivatives are used in markets such as commodities, currencies, stocks, or bonds. These contracts can be traded over the counter or through an exchange. \n  \n In the crypto industry, the futures market is a fast-growing sector that generates trillions in volume monthly. Like stock options or commodity futures contracts, crypto futures offer protection against volatility and adverse price movements on cryptocurrencies. A crypto futures contract is also a proxy tool for investors to speculate on the future prices of cryptocurrencies.

        "answer_tittle": "What is Auto-Exchange?",
        "answer": "Auto-Exchange is a mechanism to ensure that the USDT or BUSD balances in the USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet do not fall below a certain threshold.  \n When Auto-Exchange is triggered, all positive balance assets under the USDⓈ-Margined Futures Wallet are automatically converted at market price by the Auto-Exchange service engine to cover the corresponding BUSD or USDT deficit.  \n Under the Multi-Assets Mode, Auto-Exchange will happen under three circumstances: \n 1. When either the USDT or BUSD wallet balance is lower than the autoExchangeThreshold (-10,000 USD), the Auto-Exchange service engine will proportionally convert other assets in the USDⓈ-Margined Futures Wallet to USDT or BUSD to cover the deficit. \n 2. In case of liquidation, Auto-Exchange will be immediately triggered if the BUSD or USDT balance in the USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet is insufficient to cover the deficit. \n 3. When you have a negative balance in your USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet with no existing positions or open orders, the system will continuously calculate the LTV (Loan-To-Value) ratio and trigger Auto-Exchange when LTV ≥ 0.995. \n Note: LTV = abs(∑negative asset WalletBalance in USD value*(1 + Auto-Exchange Haircut)) / ∑positive asset WalletBalance in USD value*(1 - Auto-Exchange Haircut) \n When your BUSD or USDT balance in the USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet is not negative, and the  USDⓈ-Margined Future Wallet balance is over -10,000 USD, the auto-conversion will not happen.  \n Suppose either the BUSD or USDT Wallet balance is below -10,000 USD. In that case, other assets in the USDⓈ-Margined Futures Wallet will be converted to BUSD or USDT to cover the deficit, deducting the corresponding margin assets amount. \n Auto-Exchange can help you balance your account and increase the utilization rate of funds in case of losses. \n While there are no fees for Auto-Exchange, the following haircut rates (also referred to as the collateral rate) apply to the Auto-Exchanged assets to mitigate the liquidity risks: \n  \n Example 1:  \n You have a positive BTC balance and a negative USDT balance in your USDⓈ-Margined Futures Wallet while trading in the Multi-Assets Mode. Let’s assume your USDT balance falls to -20,000 USDT, which triggers the Auto-Exchange (below the -10,000 USD threshold), taking into account the 2.5% haircut rate in the process.  \n Subsequently, 20,000 USDT / 97.5% = 20,513 USDT of your BTC balance will be converted to USDT to cover the negative USDT balance in the USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet.Example 2:  \n Under the Multi-Asset Mode, if you do not have any existing position or open order, the USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet balance is 1 BNB + (-600) USDT \n Your LTV = abs(-600)/(700*(1-5%)) = 0.90 < 0.995, Auto-Exchange will not be triggered; \n Your LTV = abs(-600)/(600*(1-5%)) = 1.05 ≥ 0.995, Auto-Exchange will be triggered. Your BNB will be converted to USDT to clear the negative USDT balance. \n To avoid triggering Auto-Exchange, you can convert or transfer margin assets to the USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet to maintain the negative balance below the -$10,000 threshold. If you do not have any existing positions or open orders and there is a deficit in your USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet, you are advised to convert or transfer sufficient margin assets to the USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet in a timely manner to prevent the account LTV from going above 0.995, which would trigger Auto-Exchange. \n To reduce risks, Binance may temporarily adjust the Auto-Exchange threshold and execute the conversion automatically. You may notice that the balance of a certain asset in your USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet is negative. However, this does not necessarily mean the balance of your USDⓈ-M Futures Wallet is at a loss. \n  \n "

Whether you are using the Isolated or the Cross Margin Mode, the account status and calculation changes of various parameters are as follows: \n Under the Single-Asset Mode:  \n USDT available for order = 200 BUSD available for order = 220 \n Under the Multi-Assets Mode:  \n Account Equity = ∑min(assetEquity*bidRate, assetEquity*askRate) = 200 * 0.9801 + 220 * 1 = 416.02 \n As there are no open positions, assetCrossInitialMargin = 0  \n uniAvailableForOrder = accountEquity-∑(assetCrossInitialMargin*askRate) = 416.02 - 0 = 416.02 \n USDT Available for Order = 416.02 / 0.99495 = 418.13 \n BUSD Available for Order = 416.02 / 1 = 416.02 \n Account Maintenance Margin Ratio = 0 \n Margin Ratio = Account Maintenance Margin / Account Equity = 0 \n Account Maintenance Margin = ∑assetMM*askRate = 0.5 * 20,000 * 0.008 * 0.99495 + 20 * 600 * 0.01 * 1 = 199.596 \n As there is no unrealized PnL, Account Equity = accountWalletBalance = 416.02 \n uniAvailableForOrder = Account Equity - ∑(assetCrossInitialMargin * askRate) = 416.02 - (0.5 * 20,000 * 0.01 * 0.99495 + 20 * 600 * 0.02 * 1)= 76.525 \n USDT Available for Order = 76.525 / 0.99495 = 76.91 \n BUSD Available for Order = 76.525 / 1 = 76.525 \n Margin Ratio = Account Maintenance Margin / Account Equity = 199.596 / 416.02 = 0.47977 = 47.98% \n Account Maintenance Margin = ∑assetMM*askRate = 0.5 * 19,000 * 0.008 * 0.99495 + 20 * 620 * 0.01 * 1 = 199.61 \n With unrealized PnL, Account Equity = ∑min(assetEquity*bidRate, assetEquity*askRate) = -300 * 0.99495 + 620 * 1 = 321.515 \n uniAvailableForOrder = Account Equity - ∑(assetCrossInitialMargin * askRate) = 321.515 - (0.5 * 19,000 * 0.01 * 0.99495 + 20 * 620 * 0.02 * 1) = -21 \n USDT Available for Order and BUSD Available for Order are both 0 \n Margin Ratio = Account Maintenance Margin / Account Equity = 199.61 / 321.515 = 0.62084 = 62.08% \n "

        "answer": "The Binance Portfolio Margin trading mode offers a range of advanced features and trading rules designed to provide traders with potentially better leverage, flexibility, and more efficient risk management. This article will explore the essential trading rules, including margin checks, leverage adjustments, and various calculations associated with the Portfolio Margin mode. \n uniMMR = ∑adjusted Equity / ∑MM \n Where: \n -∑adjusted Equity is the sum of the adjusted equity across all positions in the portfolio, considering unrealized profits or losses and adjusting for the potential loss (Open Loss) when changing collateral assets in Margin-PM open orders. \n -∑MM is the sum of the unified maintenance margin amount, which includes the required margin levels across all nominated Futures and Margin-PM Accounts. \n Traders must keep a uniMMR above 1.05 (105%) to avoid liquidation risks. \n For more detailed information regarding uniMMR and liquidation, you can refer to What Is the Unified Account Maintenance Margin Ratio (uniMMR) and How Is It Calculated.  \n If new order Initial Margin < virtualAvailable → order is placed \n The Margin Check calculation takes into account various factors to determine the required margin for a traders positions ensuring they maintain sufficient collateral in their account. These factors include: \n For more information futures orders margin requirements, please refer here. \n You can have a negative balance on your USDⓈ-M Futures-PM and Coin-M Futures-PM Wallets if your uniMMR remains above the liquidation threshold (105%).  \n If your negative balances exceed the threshold, you’ll be charged an interest fee once a day at 00:00 (UTC). This interest fee is calculated based on the margin loans interest rate at 00:00 (UTC) and multiplied by 24 to charge the daily interest, and the negative balances absolute value. Please note that if you have the required assets in your Margin-PM Wallet, the system will automatically attempt to repay your negative balances within two hours before the interest charge. \n It’s also important to note that Auto-exchange does not apply to the Portfolio Margin Account. \n To calculate the interest fee: \n interest Fee = abs ( negativeBalance ) * dailyInterestRatenegativebalance = min ( walletBalance + negative_threshold, 0 ) \n Where: \n For more information, please refer to Wallet Transfers, Auto Fund Functions, and Negative Balances in Portfolio Margin Mode. \n When using the Portfolio Margin program, the Margin and Futures wallet names change to Margin-PM and Futures-PM respectively. This distinction helps traders easily identify their Portfolio Margin wallets and manage their assets accordingly. \n The Binance Portfolio Margin Program combines the position limit by default with a specific Portfolio Margin position notional limit hard cap for each symbol. \n You can refer to the dedicated USDⓈ-M Futures and Coin-M Futures tables in the [Portfolio Margin] section for a comprehensive view of the notional limits for all symbols listed. \n If a user has borrowed an asset that becomes delisted under portfolio margin, the following steps will be taken: \n Margin assets that have been delisted from Binance Cross Margin are automatically liquidated under the Portfolio Margin system. Automatic liquidation is done by selling the delisted assets into USDT, which is then added to the margin balance. This ensures that the margin account remains balanced and that the account holder does not incur any losses due to the delisting of the asset. The automatic liquidation feature provides an additional layer of security for users of Portfolio Margin, as it prevents any unexpected losses that may occur due to delisting of margin assets. \n The process of placing Cross Margin orders in the normal or Auto-Repay modes under Portfolio Margin involves a specific calculation for “available for orders”, which corresponds to the available margin for orders in USD value. \n By knowing the details of this calculation, you can have a clear understanding of your available margin when placing buy and sell orders.Margin available for orders (“virtualAvailable”): Available margin for orders in USD value. \n In the context of these calculations, its important to understand the significance of certain terms. CR1 refers to the collateral rate of the asset being sold, while CR2 refers to the collateral rate of the asset being bought. The following rules are applied based on these ratios: \n Where:X (buy orders) = AvailableBalance / quoteAssetIndexPriceX (sell orders) = AvailableBalance / baseAssetIndexPrice \n CR: Collateral RateAvailableAssetBalance: Available asset balance in the Cross Margin accountAvailableBalance: Balance available for order in the Portfolio Margin account (USD value)Available for order: Amount of assets you can use to place order on the trading page, which takes account in the previous 2 terms and CR difference between assets of the trading pair. \n Example: \n Trading Pair: BTC/USDTAvailableBalance = 1,000 USDAvailableAssetBalances: 20,000 USDT, 0.01 BTC \n quoteAssetIndexPrice = 1baseAssetIndexPrice = 28,000 \n Collateral Rate of BTC = 80%Collateral Rate of USDT = 100% \n CR1 = 100%, CR2 = 80% \n Since CR1 > CR2, Available for order = min(1,000 / 1 / (100% - 80%), 20,000) = 5,000 USDT \n CR1 = 80%, CR2 = 100% \n Since CR1 < CR2, Available for order = AvailableAssetBalance: 0.01 BTC \n Please refer to the trading interface to view your AvailableAssetBalance, AvailableBalance and Available for order: \n  \n For more details on the Binance Portfolio Margin Program, please refer to: \n "

        "answer_tittle": "1. What is UniMMR?",
        "answer": "The cornerstone of the Portfolio Margin system is the Unified Maintenance Margin Ratio (uniMMR). This ratio is used to assess the overall risk level of a traders entire portfolio, taking into account the adjusted equity and Maintenance Margin across all positions in the trading accounts in Portfolio Margin. The Unified Maintenance Margin Amount in Portfolio Margin is the total amount of Maintenance Margin a user needs to hold across all their Portfolio Margin nominated Futures Accounts and Cross Margin Accounts (in US Dollars).The uniMMR plays a crucial role in risk management, determining if a trader meets the minimum margin requirements. A higher uniMMR indicates a lower risk, while a lower uniMMR signals a higher risk and potential liquidation. \n uniMMR = Unified Account Adjusted Equity / Unified Maintenance Margin Amount \n To maintain a healthy portfolio, you must keep your uniMMR above a certain threshold. Depending on the uniMMR level, different actions or restrictions may apply, such as receiving margin call reminders, restricting new orders, or even liquidation. Monitoring the uniMMR is essential to avoid liquidation risks and ensure a well-balanced portfolio. \n Details of the uniMMR calculation: \n ∑futuresMM = ∑futuresMM_UM + ∑futuresMM_CM \n  futuresMM_UM = |MMR * Position * MarkPrice| * \n futuresMM_CM = |MMR * Notional| = |MMR * Amount* contract multiplier| \n ∑MarginMM = ∑ (Loan * MMR) The Maintenance Margin Ratio (MMR) varies based on the chosen leverage:* \n *Binance reserves the right to adjust these figures if needed. Users will receive notifications of such changes. \n OpenLoss = ∑qty * price * min(0, side * (collateralRateA - collateralRateB)) \n where: \n Unified Account Adjusted Equity in Portfolio Margin is the sum of: \n Example of Open Loss calculation \n User A holds Bitcoin (BTC) as margin in their account and places an order to buy Cardano (ADA) using BTC. The base asset is ADA, and the quote asset is BTC. BTC has a 95% Collateral Rate, while ADA has a 90% Collateral Rate. \n The buy symbol is ADA/BTC. Suppose the buy amount is 500 ADA, and the buy price is 0.001 ADA/BTC. The assetIndexPrice of BTC is 40,000 USD. \n The Open Loss can be calculated using the below formula: \n Open Loss = ∑qty * price * min(0, side * (collateralRateA-collateralRateB)) \n collateralRateA refers to the quote asset (BTC), and collateralRateB refers to the base asset (ADA). \n Open Loss = 500 * 0.001 * min (0,(-1)*(0.95 - 0.9)) \n Open Loss = 500 * 0.001 * min(0, -0.05) \n Open Loss = 500 * 0.001 *(-0.05) \n Open Loss = -0.025 BTC \n The open loss in USD = -0.025 * 40,000 = -1,000 USD \n In this example, the Open Loss is 1,000 USD, indicating a potential reduction in Equity Value of $1,000 due to the execution of the ADA-to-BTC buy order, considering their different Collateral Rates. \n ∑MM (Unified Maintenance Margin Amount) is the total amount of Maintenance Margin or the margin required to maintain margin levels, held across all nominated Futures and Cross Margin Accounts (in US Dollars). \n MaxWithdraw is the maximum amount of an asset you can withdraw from your Margin account without making your uniMMR go under 105%. It takes into account your wallet balance, virtual available balance, and the required collateral rate to ensure the remaining assets can still cover your positions and maintain the required margin levels. \n MaxWithdraw for USDT in the Margin Portfolio Margin account = max(min (margin free asset, virtual available balance / asset index price / collateral rate), 0)  \n Where:  \n virtualAvaliable balance = max(∑adjustedEquity-∑IM ,0) \n  \n MaxLoan is The maximum Loan you can contract on your Margin-PM Account.  \n MaxLoan = max(min (virtualMaxLoan / assetIndexPrice, Max_Borrow-Current Loan, 0) \n Virtual MaxLoan = (Leverage - 1) * max( virtualAvailable balance，0) \n Where:  \n virtualAvaliable balance = max( ∑adjustedEquity - ∑IM ,0) \n The following table outlines the uniMMR levels and corresponding status of the Portfolio Margin Account on Binance. UniMMR is considered healthy above 1.5 (150%). Please note that liquidation will take place when UniMMR drops to 1.05 (105%). \n  \n For more details on the Binance Portfolio Margin Program, please refer to: \n Suppose User A has the following margin assets, loan, and open orders.They use a 3x leverage in the Cross Margin mode. \n MarginMM = (Loan * MMR) / (1 - MMR), while MMR = marginMM / marginAsset = 1 - 1 / 1.1 with 3x leverage. \n Well calculate User As OpenLoss using the following formula: \n OpenLoss = ∑qty * price * min(0, side * (collateralRateA - collateralRateB)) \n Where: \n Heres a summary of User As openLoss for each order on Cross Margin: \n Hence, openLoss = -160.02 + 0 = -160.02 USDT \n Let’s calculate User A’s Equity, Initial Margin (IM), and Maintenance Margin (MM): \n MarginIM = MarginLoan / ( leverage - 1 ) \n *Leverage is 3x by default in the Cross Margin mode \n ∑MarginMM = ∑ (Loan * MMR) / (1 - MMR) = ((Asset-Equity) * MMR) / (1 - MMR)Here, Margin MM for each asset can be calculated as follows:Margin MM = Margin Loan * MMR / (1 - MMR) , MMR is calculated as 1 - 1/1.1 ≈ 0.0909⇒ Margin MM = Margin Loan * 0.1Using this MMR value, we can calculate the Cross-Margin MM for each asset: \n Initial Margin Rate (IMR): IMR is a percentage of the total value of a position that a trader is required to hold as collateral in their account when opening a new trade. It represents the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited to cover potential losses. A higher IMR indicates a lower level of leverage and a larger amount of required collateral. \n Maintenance Margin Ratio (MMR): MMR is the minimum percentage of the total value of a position that a trader must maintain in their account to keep the position open after it has been established. It serves as a safety net to ensure that the trader have enough funds to cover potential losses and avoid liquidation. If the accounts equity falls below this rate, the position will be liquidated to prevent further losses. \n User A also has the following Futures positions, unrealized PnL, and assets in the USDⓈ-M Futures and COIN-M Futures accounts: \n Let’s calculate User A’s Equity, IM, and MM (Maintenance Margin) on USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures: \n *Initial Margin = Notional Position Value / Leverage Level \n Knowing that UniMMR = ∑adjustedEquity /∑MM, let’s combine the above calculations to get the Unified Account Adjusted Equity and Unified Maintenance Margin Amount for every asset held in User A’s Cross Margin and Futures accounts: \n 0.02 + 0.025 \n = 0.045 \n We now have enough data to calculate the uniMMR. As a reminder, uniMMR = ∑adjustedEquity /∑MM \n Unified Account Adjusted Equity = ∑Equity -  OpenLoss * assetIndexPrice = (6,186 * 0.99 * 1.001) + (0.11 * 40,000 * 0.95) + (5 * 2,100 * 0.95)  - 160.02 * 1.001 =  20,125.08 \n Unified Maintenance Margin Amount = USDT MM * Asset IndexPrice + BTC MM * Asset IndexPrice + ETH MM * Asset IndexPrice =  (18.4 * 1.001) + (0.00525 * 40,000) + (1.5 * 2,100) = 3,378.41 \n uniMMR = ( 20,125.08 / 3,378.41) = 5.96 (595.6%) \n MaxWithdraw is the maximum amount of an asset a user can withdraw from their Margin Account without breaching the required margin levels. It takes into account the users wallet balance, virtual available balance, and the required collateral rate to ensure the remaining assets can still cover the users positions and maintain the required margin levels. \n  \n Lets calculate the MaxWithdraw for User A: \n Lets assume User A would like to borrow some BTC. To calculate their maxLoan amount, we can use the following formula: \n virtualMaxLoan = (Leverage - 1)*max(virtualAvaliable balance, 0) \n =(3 - 1) * (2,206.712, 0) = 4,413.424 \n MaxLoan for BTC = min (VirtualMaxLoan / assetIndexPrice, MaxBorrow - CurrentLoan) = min(4,413.424/40,000, 10 - 0.04) = 0.11033560 \n Where: \n "

        "answer": "1. Liquidation based on the Unified Maintenance Margin ratio (UniMMR) level \n Liquidation occurs when an account’s uniMMR falls below 1.05 (105%). In such cases, the liquidation system will take over the account, and you won’t be able to perform any transactions during the liquidation process. \n When the uniMMR reaches 1.5, the system will cancel any open orders on Cross-Margin, and a liquidation notice will be sent to the account holder. If the uniMMR recovers above 1.5 before the liquidation takes place, the liquidation will be canceled. \n To learn how to calculate uniMMR refer to What Is the Unified Account Maintenance Margin Ratio (uniMMR) And How Is It Calculated. \n 2. Liquidation due to negative Unified Account Adjusted Equity Value \n Additionally, liquidation can occur when your Unified Account Adjusted Equity falls below 0, even if there are no open positions, loans, or orders in the account.  \n This can happen due to exchange rate fluctuations, especially in cases where a user has a negative balance in one asset and a positive balance in another. You should be aware of this possibility and manage your account balances accordingly to avoid liquidation in such situations. \n For example, if you don’t have open positions, loans, or orders but you’re holding: \n Initially, your Unified Account Adjusted Equity stands at 30 USD. However, should the BTC price drop to 15,000 USDT, your Adjusted Equity would fall below 0, triggering liquidation. \n When your margin position is liquidated, the margin liquidation engine will take over the assets on the account and sell them to cover the liabilities. \n All liquidation orders are executed as Immediate or Cancel (IOC) orders during the liquidation process. IOC orders aim to fill as much of the liquidated position as possible. If there are any remaining positions after the partial execution of the order, they will be handled in one of two ways: \n Binance applies liquidation clearance fees for both Margin and Futures positions. Please refer to the respective articles for more details on liquidation clearance fees for futures and margin positions. \n Binance will notify you by email and via App notifications when your uniMMR falls below the following levels: \n When your account is in reduce-only or liquidation mode, the following order entry error codes will be in effect: \n For more details on the Binance Portfolio Margin Program, please refer to: \n "

        "answer": "In the Portfolio Margin mode, you can access a wide range of order types, including: \n Classic Orders: \n Advanced order types, such as stop limit, stop market, trailing stop, are also known as strategy orders. They are executed through a separate strategy service system, which adds an additional layer of complexity to the Portfolio Margin order logic. \n The execution of conditional orders, such as stop limit, stop market, trailing stop orders, is subject to various factors, such as market conditions. Therefore, they cannot guarantee execution. Please take note of all potential risks when placing these types of orders, Binance shall not be liable for any resulting losses. \n It is important to note that Binances Portfolio Margin trading API does not support order modifications yet. If you need to cancel an existing order via API, you can use the cancel order endpoints.  \n Please refer to this FAQ for a list of the supported endpoints in Portfolio Margin.  \n Conditional orders are managed separately in the trading interface, which lets you manage your positions more effectively. \n Before being triggered, you can view them under the [Untriggered Orders] tab from [Open Orders] or [Order History]. \n Once a strategy order is triggered, it will be moved to the [Normal Orders] tab. \n Portfolio Margin benefits from cross-system interaction between the main trading platform and the strategy service system. It enhances the versatility and capabilities of users’ trading experience. However, network latency and other factors might occasionally cause minor disruptions. \n For example, brief synchronization delays might occur when you cancel an order or view your order history. They could result in a slight lag in cancellation requests or order status updates. Rest assured that these instances are not frequent and can generally be resolved quickly. \n In Portfolio Margin, the Reduce Only order logic differs from the one-way position mode in the default mode. Reduce Only orders are used to close a position or decrease its size, and cannot be placed to open a position in the opposite direction. \n If the remaining quantity, calculated by taking the absolute value of the position quantity and  subtracting the sum of the order quantity for closing the position, is less than the order quantity, the Reduce Only (RO) order will be rejected. \n Remaining quantity = abs (position qty) - abs (sum of close position open orders qty)Sum of close position open orders qty: the combined quantity of all open orders placed to adjust or close the existing position. \n For more details on the Binance Portfolio Margin Program, please refer to: \n "

        "answer": "The Portfolio Margin mode has streamlined the fund transfer features to improve user experience. You can use the new Aggregate balances and Auto Repay functions to better manage your funds.  \n Transferring funds between different wallets is an essential aspect of managing your Portfolio Margin account. Portfolio Margin supports fund transfers between Margin-PM and Futures-PM with some restrictions. You can also transfer funds between PM-Wallets and other Binance Wallets, but there are restrictions as well. The restrictions are explained in the Portfolio Margin Wallet Transfer Rules below. \n Note: Additionally, the BNB logic is incorporated into the Portfolio Margin program. You can use BNB for fees and benefit from discounted trading fees. \n Portfolio Margin Wallet Transfer Rules: \n The [Transfer BNB] button lets you transfer BNB from your Margin-PM Wallet to your USDⓈ-M-PM Wallet. This allows you to enjoy reduced fees and optimize your trading costs when engaging in futures trading on the platform.Note: You can also use this function ten times per a rolling 10-minute period. \n The Aggregate balances function simplifies the fund transfer process between different wallets and reduces potential errors associated with manual transfers.  \n When you click the [Aggregate balances] button or send an API request, the system will automatically transfer all positive balances from your USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets to your Margin-PM Wallet.  \n Please note that unlike other assets, your BNB in the USDⓈ-M Futures-PM Wallet won’t be automatically transferred.  \n Note: For API support specifications, please refer to the “Fund Auto-collection” section on the GitHub API documentation. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and go to [Wallet] - [Futures-PM]. Click [Transfer]. \n 2. Click [Aggregate balances], and all your positive balances will be transferred to your Margin Wallet. \n API details: \n The Auto Repay function can automatically repay your negative balances in the USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets by transferring the corresponding assets from your Margin-PM Wallet, provided that you have the same assets in your Margin-PM Wallet. No auto repayments will occur if you don’t have the required assets in your Margin-PM Wallet. In this case, you need to manually transfer the necessary assets into your Margin-PM Wallet to allow the auto-repay process to operate. \n Auto Repay Function Schedule \n The Auto Repay function operates once a day, within 2 hours before charging the negative balance interest. The daily interest charge time is 00:00 (UTC). \n Example of the Auto Repay Function  \n If the system auto-repays 50% of your BTC negative balance at 22:50 (UTC) and you transfer more BTC into your Margin-PM Wallet at 23:00 (UTC), the system won’t auto-repay again on the same day (as the function only operates once a day). \n Limitations of the USDⓈ-M PM and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets \n Auto-repayment only happens from the Margin-PM Wallet to the USDⓈ-M PM and COIN-M PM Wallets. This means your USDⓈ-M PM and COIN-M PM Wallets cannot automatically repay each others negative balances.  \n For example, if you have a positive BTC balance in the COIN-M Futures-PM Wallet and a negative BTC balance in the USDⓈ-M PM Wallet as a result of trading ETHBTC USDⓈ-M Futures contract, auto-repayment cannot occur. In this case, you must manually transfer BTC from the COIN-M Futures-PM Wallet to the Margin-PM Wallet using the Aggregate balances function. After that, auto-repayment can occur from the Margin-PM Wallet to the USDⓈ-M PM Wallet. \n The Auto Repay function is activated by default. You can deactivate it and switch to [Manual Repay] from [Wallet] - [Futures-PM]. \n Note: \n Interest charges \n Please note that negative balances in the USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets may incur interest charges. However, there is an interest-free threshold for each asset. For more details on the threshold per asset, please refer to the table in #9.  \n Repayment order \n The Auto Repay function will repay the negative balances in your USDⓈ-M or COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets in no particular order. For example, you have negative balances in USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets after trading BTC-Margin contracts. The Auto Repay function will perform repayments in a random order.  \n NegativeBalance for a specific asset occurs when the total balance of free assets (shown as “available balance”) in Cross-Margin-PM and assets in the USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets becomes negative, indicating a deficit in that particular asset*. This is calculated individually, with a specific negative balance threshold for each asset.* \n Negative balances are allowed as long as your Unified Maintenance Margin Ratio (uniMMR) remains above the liquidation threshold of 105%. \n If your negative balances exceed the threshold, you’ll be charged an interest fee once a day at 00:00 (UTC). This interest fee is calculated based on your Margin Loans daily interest rate and the negative balances absolute value. Please note that if you have the required assets in your Wallet, the system will automatically attempt to repay your negative balances within two hours before the interest charge. \n Please note that Auto-exchange does not apply to the Portfolio Margin Account. \n To calculate the interest fee: \n interestFee = abs(negativeBalance) * dailyInterestRatenegativeBalance = min(totalAssetBalanceAcrossPMWallets + negative_threshold,0) \n Where: \n For example, if your negative balance is -10,050 USDT and the daily interest rate for your Margin Loan is 0.1%, the interest fee would be: \n interestFee = abs(-50) * 0.001 = 0.05 USDT \n *For instance, if your BTC balance is negative in the USDⓈ-M Wallet, but is counterbalanced by a positive BTC balance in the COIN-M Futures-PM or Margin-PM Wallets, it will result in a net positive overall BTC balance in Portfolio Margin-supported wallets. NegativeBalance for BTC will not apply, and no interest will be charged. \n Users with sub-accounts can transfer assets between cross margin accounts under the same main account. \n Asset transfers between sub-accounts are managed using the following POST API endpoint: /sapi/v1/sub-account/universalTransfer.You can refer to Binance Link API Docs for more details. \n For more details on the Binance Portfolio Margin Program, please refer to: \n "

        "answer": "Binance uses a sophisticated risk control system and liquidation model to support high leverage trading by adopting the Maintenance Margin model. For the latest updates, please refer to the Leverage & Margin page. \n The maximum amount of leverage available depends on the notional value of your position — the larger the position, the lower the leverage. You can adjust the leverage according to your needs, and all position sizes are calculated based on the contracts notional value. Thus, the Initial Margin is determined by the leverage you selected. \n Please note that you should first choose your leverage (and fulfill the Initial Margin requirement) before opening positions. The higher the leverage, the smaller the notional size you can open; the lower the leverage, the higher the notional size you can open. \n Effective July 27, 2021, Binance Futures set leverage limits for users who registered their futures accounts in less than 60 days. The following leverage limits has been applied:From the effective date, new users who registered their Futures accounts in less than 60 days cannot open positions with leverage exceeding 20x.The new leverage limits also apply to existing users who registered their Futures accounts in less than 60 days:All the new positions you open must be maintained below 20x leverage.You can maintain your existing positions opened before July 27, 2021 beyond 20x leverage, but you cannot increase the leverage further. You can only reduce the leverage of your open positions to 20x or below.For new users with no open positions, all new positions must not exceed 20x leverage.Leverage limits for new users will gradually increase after 60 days from account registration. \n Effective July 27, 2021, Binance Futures set leverage limits for users who registered their futures accounts in less than 60 days. The following leverage limits has been applied: \n The system will display the maximum allowable position size for different tiers of leverage as shown below: \n The Maintenance Margin is a critical term used in trading, specifically in futures. It refers to the minimum amount of collateral that a trader must maintain in their account to keep their leveraged position open. The Maintenance Margin is calculated based on the value of a traders open positions at different notional value tiers. \n Maintenance Margin = Notional Position Value * Maintenance Margin Rate - Maintenance Amount \n Please refer to the Leverage and Margin table for the most updated information regarding Notional Position Values, maximum leverages, and the corresponding Maintenance Margin rates and maintenance amounts. \n The Maintenance Margin is calculated based on your positions at different notional value tiers. This means that the Maintenance Margin is always calculated in the same way, regardless of what leverage you select. Moving from one tier to another will not cause the previous tier to change its leverage. The larger the position, the higher the Maintenance Margin rate. \n In most exchanges, the Maintenance Margin is usually half of the Initial Margin. At Binance, however, the Maintenance Margin is only less than half of the Initial Margin, which is more beneficial to traders. \n It is important to note that the Maintenance Margin will directly affect the liquidation price. To avoid auto-deleveraging, it is highly recommended to close your positions before the collateral falls below the Maintenance Margin.  \n Maintenance margin calculations are done via a “Bracket” setup and are always calculated the same way, regardless of what leverage you choose. Moving from one bracket to another will not cause the earlier bracket to change its leverage. To avoid auto-liquidation, you should liquidate positions before the collateral falls below the Maintenance Margin. \n 1. Can I adjust the leverage of an open position? \n If you have an open position in the Cross Margin Mode, you can increase/lower the leverage by using the [Adjust Leverage] button. \n If you have an open position in the Isolated Margin Mode, you cannot reduce the leverage. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "1. Introduction to Mark Price and Price Index",
        "answer": "The Mark Price is a mechanism used in crypto futures trading on Binance to ensure fair and accurate pricing of futures contracts. \n The Price index is used to mitigate risks arising from price volatility and market manipulation by providing a more stable reference point. Instead of the assets last price, the Price Index takes into account the price of the asset across multiple exchanges. You may read more about the differences between the Mark Price and the Last Price in this blog article. \n On Binance Futures, a contracts Mark Price is determined by considering several factors such as the futures contracts Last Price, the bid1 and ask1 series from the order book, the funding rate, and a composite average of the underlying assets spot price on major crypto exchanges. \n The Price Index is used to calculate the Mark Price and is based on the weighted average spot price of the asset across multiple crypto exchanges. \n The Price Index is the primary component of Mark Price. It is the weighted average value of the underlying asset listed on major spot exchanges, which reflects the fair market value of the futures contract and is constantly updated to account for any changes in the asset’s spot price or the weighting of the exchanges used to calculate the index. \n At Binance, the Price Index for USDⓈ-M Futures contracts derives prices from KuCoin, Huobi, OKX, HitBTC, Gate.io, Ascendex, MXC, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, and Bybit. \n You can check the real-time Price Index Info on the Binance website. \n Price Index = Sum of (Weight Percent of Exchange A * The Symbol’s Spot Price on Exchange A + Weight Percent of Exchange B * The Symbol’s Spot Price on Exchange B +...+ Weight Percent of Exchange N * The Symbol’s Spot Price on Exchange N) \n Where: \n Weight Percent of Exchange i = Weight of Exchange i / Total Weight \n Total Weight = Sum of (Weight of Exchange A + Weight of Exchange B + ...+ Weight of Exchange N) \n Please note that in the event of extreme price volatility or deviation from the Price Index, Binance will undertake additional protective measures, including but not limited to changing the constituents of the Price Index. \n Binance also undertakes additional protections to avoid poor market performance during Spot exchange outages or connectivity issues: \n You can refer to the latest exchange reference on the Price Index. \n Note: \n You can consider the Price Index as the “Spot Price”. Let’s see how to calculate the Mark Price for all Unrealized PnL calculations. Please note that Realized PnL is based on the actual executed market prices. \n Compared to Perpetual Futures prices, the Mark Price better estimates a contract’s ‘true’ value as it is less volatile in the short term. Binance uses the Mark Price to prevent unnecessary liquidations and discourage market manipulations by bad actors. \n On Binance Futures, the Mark Price of a contract is calculated by taking into account several factors. These include the Last Price of the futures contract, the bid1 and ask1 series from the order book, the funding rate, and a composite average of the underlying assets spot price on major crypto exchanges. \n The calculation of the Mark Price is intricately linked to the Funding Rate and vice versa. As Unrealized PNL is the primary driver of liquidations, it is essential to ensure that the Unrealized PnL calculation is accurate to avoid unnecessary liquidations. The underlying contract for the Perpetual Contract is the ‘true’ value of the Contract, and an average of the prices on the major markets constitutes the Price Index, which is the primary component of Mark Price.  \n Mark price = Median (Price 1, Price 2, Contract Price) ** \n Price 1 = Price Index * (1 + Last Funding Rate * (Time until next Funding / Funding period) \n Where:  \n **Please note that the funding fee is a payment between long- and short-position holders. Binance only serves as a neutral intermediary in the transaction. \n Price 2 = Price Index + Moving Average (5-minute Basis) ** \n **The Moving Average (5-minute Basis) is calculated by taking the average of the bid and ask prices and subtracting the Price Index, before taking the average of that value over the last 5 minutes, calculated every 5 seconds (60 data points). \n Moving Average (5-minute Basis) = sum of [(Bid1_i + Ask1_i)/2 - PI_i] /60  \n Where: \n **Please refer to the Price Index for each USDⓈ-M Futures Contract.  \n **Median: If Price 1 < Price 2 < Contract Price, then Price 2 will be taken as the Mark Price. \n Please note that the Mark Price may deviate from the spot price due to extreme market conditions or deviations in price sources. Binance will take additional protective measures, i.e., calculating Mark Price = Price 2. \n During system upgrades or system downtime, where all trading activities are paused, the system will continue to use the Mark price formula to calculate the Mark Price, and the Moving Average (5-minute Basis) in Price 2 will be set to 0 until the system is back to normal. \n  \n "

        "answer": "Tutorial video \n USDT-Margined Quarterly Contracts are quoted, settled, and collateralized in USDT. USDT-Margined contracts are not inverse products. Instead, they are linear contracts that offer clear pricing rules. A quarterly contract has a set expiration date and settlement, it will expire on the last Friday of the quarter. For example, “BTCUSDT Quarterly 0326” indicates that the expiration date is set for 2021-03-26 8:00 AM (UTC). \n One of the key benefits of USDT-Settled Contracts is that you can easily calculate your returns in fiat. This makes USDT-Margined Contracts more intuitive. For example, when you make 500 USDT in profit, you can easily estimate that the profit is worth approximately $500 - since the value of 1 USDT is pegged closely to 1 USD. \n USDT-margined quarterly contracts offer the following characteristics: \n For complete USDT-M Futures Contract specifications, please refer to Trading Rules. \n Notes: \n 1. Go to Binance Futures and click [USDⓈ-M Futures] - [USDT Delivery].  \n 2. Click on the current contract’s name (set to [BTCUSDT Quarterly] by default) and a dropdown menu will appear. Please check that you are on the [USDⓈ-M] - [Delivery] tab. \n 3. Select either [BTCUSDT Quarterly] or [ETHUSDT Quarterly] to view their price charts and place orders. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What defines a self-trade?",
        "answer": "Self Trade Prevention (STP) is a mechanism employed by trading platforms to prevent users from inadvertently trading against themselves. This situation, known as self-trading, occurs when a users own orders match each other on the order book. STP is particularly important in maintaining a fair and transparent trading environment, as it helps to prevent manipulation of market prices and ensures that trading activity accurately reflects genuine market interest. At Binance, Self Trade Prevention (STP) prevents orders of users, or the users tradeGroupId, to match against their own. \n A self-trade can occur in either scenario: \n There are four possible modes for what the system will do if an order could create a self-trade. \n The STP event will occur depending on the STP mode of the taker order. Thus, the STP mode of an order that goes on the book is no longer relevant and will be ignored for all future order processing. \n STP can only be set using field selfTradePreventionMode through the API endpoints below: \n Different accounts with the same tradeGroupId are considered part of the same trade group. Orders submitted by members of a trade group are eligible for STP according to the taker-orders STP mode. \n A user can confirm if their accounts are under the same tradeGroupId from the API either from GET fapi/v2/account (REST API). \n If the value is -1, then the tradeGroupId has not been set for that account, so the STP may only take place between orders of the same account. \n Currently, Binance doesn’t support grouping sub-accounts under the same tradeGroupId. This functionality will be included in future updates, stay tuned. \n Placing orders on all symbols in GET fapi/v1/exchangeInfo can set selfTradePreventionMode. \n LIMIT/MARKET/STOP/TAKE_PROFIT/STOP_MARKET/TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET/TRAILING_STOP_MARKET all supports STP when Time in force(timeInForce) set to GTC/ IOC/ GTD. STP wont take effect for Time in force(timeInForce) FOK or GTX. \n No. Modify order that has reset selfTradePreventionMode to NONE. \n Youll see the order status is EXPIRED_IN_MATCH. \n In user data stream event ORDER_TRADE_UPDATE, field X would be EXPIRED_IN_MATCH if order is expired due to STP \n {  e:ORDER_TRADE_UPDATE,      // Event Type  E:1568879465651,             // Event Time  T:1568879465650,             // Transaction Time  o:{                                s:BTCUSDT,               // Symbol    c:TEST,                  // Client Order Id      // special client order id:      // starts with autoclose-: liquidation order      // adl_autoclose: ADL auto close order      // settlement_autoclose-: settlement order for delisting or delivery    S:SELL,                  // Side    o:TRAILING_STOP_MARKET,  // Order Type    f:GTC,                   // Time in Force    q:0.001,                 // Original Quantity    p:0,                     // Original Price    ap:0,                    // Average Price    sp:7103.04,              // Stop Price.

        "answer": "Traditionally, the price of a quarterly futures contract will converge with its corresponding spot price as the contract expires after the three-month period. As the contract runs down towards expiry, the Mark price will closely reflect spot prices, and the moving average basis component will no longer be part of the Mark price calculation. This means that the Mark price of a quarterly futures contract will be computed differently as it reaches the time of expiration. \n Mark Price = Price Index + Moving Average (5-minute Basis)* \n *The Moving Average (5-minute Basis) is calculated by taking the average of the bid and ask prices, subtracting the Price Index, and then taking the average of that value over the last 5 minutes. This calculation is done every 5 seconds, resulting in 60 data points. \n Moving Average (5-minute Basis) = sum of [(Bid1_i + Ask1_i) / 2 - PI_i] / 60 \n i) The time to delivery is greater than 1 hour \n Using BTCUSDT 0924 as an example: \n Mark Price before 24 September 2020, 06:59:59 UTC \n = Price Index + Moving Average (5-minute Basis)* \n *Moving Average (5-minute Basis) = Moving Average ((Bid1+Ask1)/2- Price Index), measures every minute in a 5-minute interval \n Please note: \n During the system upgrade or the system down that pending all trading activities, the Mark price of a Quarterly Futures Contract whose time to delivery is greater than 1 hour is calculated as follows: \n Keep the Mark price formula but use the Bid1 and Ask1 at the system stop time to calculate Moving Average (5-minute Basis) until the system is back to normal. \n Assume Binance uses an equally-weighted price average; the prices of BTCUSDT trading pairs on the selected exchanges are 10,000 USDT, 10,0001 USDT, 10,0002 USDT, 10,003 USDT, and 10,004 USDT, respectively. \n Price Index = (10,000 + 10,001 + 10,002 + 10,003 + 10,004) / 5 = 10,002 USDT \n The Moving Average (5-minute Basis) is calculated by taking the average of the bid and ask prices, subtracting the Price Index, and then taking the average of that value over the last 5 minutes.

        "answer": "Binance Futures uses Mark Price as a reference in liquidations and calculations of unrealized PNL. Mark Price is an estimated fair value of a contract and it differs from ‘Last Price’. Mark Price is used to prevent unfair and unnecessary liquidations that may happen when the market is highly volatile. Additionally, it also helps prevent price manipulation. \n It is important to note that mark prices in both perpetual contracts and quarterly contracts are different and they are computed with different formulas and methodologies. We highly recommended reading both support pages (Mark Price in Perpetual Futures and Mark Price in Quarterly Futures) to get a clear understanding of mark price methodologies. \n A Mark price consists of two components: Price Index and Moving Average (MA) Basis. \n A moving average basis is used as the second component of a Mark price calculation. It helps to smooth out the price data over a specified period of time by creating a constantly updated average price. This methodology reduces the possibility of unfair and unnecessary liquidations when the market is highly volatile. \n Price Index is an aggregate price extracted from the major spot exchanges, weighted by their relative volume; this is done to prevent price manipulation from a single exchange. The Price Index for Coin-Margined contracts derives prices from Bitstamp, Coinbase Pro, Kraken, Bittrex, Binance, Huobi, and OKX. \n More information can be found on the Price Index references of each Coin-Margined contract. \n Mark price = Median*(Price 1, Price 2, Contract Price) \n Price 1 = Price Index*(1 + Last Funding Rate*(Time Until Funding / 8)) \n Price 2 = Price Index + Moving Average (5-minute Basis) * \n *Moving Average (5-minute Basis) = Moving Average ((Bid1+Ask1)/2- Price Index), which measures every minute in a 5-minute interval. \n **The Moving Average (5-minute Basis) is calculated by taking the average of the bid and ask prices and subtracting the Price Index, before taking the average of that value over the last 5 minutes, calculated every 5 seconds (60 data points). \n Moving Average (5-minute Basis) = sum of [(Bid1_i + Ask1_i)/2 - PI_i] /60 \n *Median: If Price 1 < Price 2 < Contract Price, then take Price 2 as Mark price. \n Please note that due to extreme market conditions or deviations in price sources, which may lead to the Mark price deviating from the spot price, Binance will take additional protective measures, i.e. Mark price = Price 2 in this scenario. \n During the system upgrade or the system down that pending all trading activities, the Mark price calculation is as follows: \n Keep the Mark price formula but set Moving Average (5-minute Basis) in Price2 to 0 until the system is back to normal. \n Mark price is a better estimate of the ‘true’ value of the contract, compared to Perpetual Futures prices which can be more volatile in the short term. We use this price to prevent unnecessary liquidations for traders and to discourage any market manipulations by bad actors. \n Traditionally, the price of a Quarterly Futures Contract will converge with its corresponding spot price as the contract expires after the three-month period. As the contract runs down towards expiry, the Mark price will closely reflect spot prices and the moving average basis component will no longer be part of the Mark price calculation. This means that the Mark price of a quarterly futures contract will be computed differently as it reaches the time of expiration. \n Mark Price = Price Index + Moving Average (15-minute Basis) * \n *Moving Average (15-minute Basis) = Moving Average ((Bid1+Ask1)/2- Price Index), measures every minute in a 15-minute interval. \n i) The time to delivery is greater than 1 hour \n Using BTCUSD 0925 as an example: \n Mark Price before 25 September 2020, 06:59:59 UTC \n = Price Index + Moving Average (15-minute Basis) * \n *Moving Average (15-minute Basis) = Moving Average ((Bid1+Ask1)/2- Price Index), measures every minute in a 15-minute interval. \n Please note: \n  During the system upgrade or the system down that pending all trading activities, the Mark price of a Quarterly Futures Contract whose time to delivery is greater than 1 hour is calculated as follows: \n Keep the Mark price formula but use the Bid1 and Ask1 at the system stopped time to calculate Moving Average (15-minute Basis) until the system is back to normal. \n Step 1: Calculate the Price Index \n Assume Binance uses an equally-weighted price average, the prices of BTCUSD trading pairs on the selected exchanges are 10,000 USD, 10,0001 USD, 10,0002 USD, 10,003 USD and 10,004 USD respectively. \n Price Index = (10,000 + 10,001 + 10,002 + 10,003 + 10,004) / 5 = 10,002 USD \n Step 2: Calculate the Moving Average on 15-minute Basis \n Moving Average (15-minute Basis) \n = Moving Average (Mid-Price*- Price Index), which measures every minute in a 15-minute interval. \n *Mid-Price = (Bid1+Ask1)/2 \n To calculate the moving average, we need to get the mid-price from the order book and Price Index of the first second of every minute for the past 15 minutes, then we will have n=15 in total. \n For example, if we want to calculate the Mark Price of BTCUSD 0925 at 12:15:00 UTC, the Mid-Price and Price Index are as follows: \n Moving Average (15-minute Basis) \n = Moving Average (Mid-Price - Price Index) \n = [(Mid-Price - Price Index)1 + (Mid-Price - Price Index)2 + … + (Mid-Price - Price Index)180 ] / 180 \n = [(10,003 - 10,001) + (10,004 - 10,002) + … + (10,005 - 10,006)] / 180 \n  \n Step 3: Substitute the Price Index and Moving Average (15-minute Basis) into the formula \n Let say Price Index = 10,002 USD and Moving Average (15-minute Basis) = -1 \n Mark Price at 12:15:00 UTC \n = Price Index + Moving Average (15-minute Basis) \n = 10,002 USD - 1 USD \n = 10,001 USD \n ii) Time to delivery is equal or less than 1 hour \n Mark Price on 25 September 2020, 07:00:00 - 07:59:59 UTC \n = Average of Price Index (every second from 07:00:00 and 07:59:59 UTC on the delivery day) \n Step 1: Calculate the Price Index \n Assume Binance uses an equally-weighted price average, the prices of BTCUSD trading pairs on the selected exchanges are 10,000 USD, 10,0001 USD, 10,0002 USD, 10,003 USD and 10,004 USD respectively. \n Price Index = (10,000 + 10,001 + 10,002 + 10,003 + 10,004) / 5 = 10,002 USD \n Step 2: Calculate the Average of Price Index \n Mark Price at Time n \n = (Price Index 1 + Price Index 2 + … + Price Index n) / n \n Example: \n Mark Price at 7:00:02 on 25 September \n = (Price Index at 7:00:00 + Price Index at 7:00:01 + Price Index at 7:00:02) / 3 \n = (10,002 + 10,003 + 10,004) / 3 \n = 10,003 \n "

        "answer": "Binance uses a sophisticated risk control system and liquidation model to support high-leverage trading by adopting the Maintenance Margin model. For the latest updates, please refer to the Leverage & Margin page. \n Important note: Effective July 27th, 2021, Binance Futures introduced leverage limits for users with registered futures accounts of less than 60 days. The following leverage limits apply: \n From the effective date, new users with registered futures accounts of less than 60 days will not be allowed to open positions with leverage exceeding 20x. \n The new leverage limits will also apply to existing users with registered futures accounts of less than 60 days: \n For new users with no open positions, all new positions must not exceed 20x leverage. Leverage limits for new users will gradually increase only after 60 days from registration. \n All leverage and margin tiers of Coin-Margined futures contracts can be accessed via the Leverage & Margin page. \n The maximum amount of leverage available for users depends on the notional value of their position. Generally, the larger the position, the lower the leverage allowed. Thus, initial margin deposits are calculated using the leverage selected by the trader. \n Maintenance margin calculations are done via a “Tax Bracket” setup. This means that the maintenance margin is always calculated the same way, regardless of what leverage the trader selects. Moving from one bracket to another will not cause the earlier bracket to change its leverage. Again, as noted earlier, it is highly recommended for the trader to liquidate positions before the collateral falls below the Maintenance Margin to avoid auto-liquidation. \n Traders should ensure that they have the minimum required amount of funds in their wallet before opening a position. The cost required to open a position includes the Initial Margin and open loss (if any). Open loss occurs when the order price is unfavorable to the traders, i.e., Mark Price is lower than the order price for a long order. Binance includes open loss as one of the costs required to open a position to avoid forced liquidation when the traders place the order. If open loss is not counted, there is a high probability that users’ position will get liquidated immediately once they have placed such orders. \n Cost = Initial Margin + Open Loss (if any) \n Initial Margin \n = Notional Value / Leverage Level \n = [ (10*100 USD) / 9,800 USD ] / 20 \n = 0.0051 BTC \n  \n Open Loss = Number of Contract x Contract Multiplier x Absolute Value {min[0, direction of order x (1 / order price - 1 /mark price)]} \n *direction of order: 1 for long order；-1 for short order \n Open loss of long order \n = 10 x 100 USD x Absolute Value {min[0, 1 x (1 / 9,800 USD - 1 / 9,602.6 USD)]} \n = 0.002097646 BTC \n Open loss of short order \n = 10 x 100 USD x Absolute Value {min[0, 1 x (1 / 9,800 USD - 1 / 9,602.6 USD)]} \n = 0 \n  \n Since the long order has open loss, thus the cost required to open a long position is higher as we need to take open loss into consideration besides the initial margin. \n Cost Required to Open a Long Position \n = 0.0051 BTC + 0.002096562 BTC \n = 0.0072 BTC (difference due to rounding off) \n Short order has no open loss, thus the cost required to open a short position is equivalent to the initial margin. \n Cost Required to Open a Short Position \n = 0.0051 BTC + 0 = 0.0051 BTC \n *Disclaimer: The numbers in this article are subject to change without further notice.

        "answer": "Tutorial video \n A Quarterly Futures Contract is an agreement to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price at a specified time (delivery date) in the future. Unlike Perpetual Futures Contracts, Quarterly Futures Contracts have an expiration date. \n When the Quarterly Futures Contract is due, both the contract buyer (in a long position) and the seller (in a short position) are obligated to execute the contract regardless of the underlying asset’s price. The buyer gains if the settlement price is higher than the entry price, while the seller gains if the settlement is lower than the entry price. \n The first Quarterly Futures Contract launched by Binance Futures was the “BTCUSD Quarterly 0925”. The ticker name indicates the underlying asset and the expiry date. \n BTCUSD Quarterly Futures Contracts are quoted and settled in the denominated BTC tokens. They also use BTC as the collateral. It means that in order to trade this contract, you must have BTC in your Futures Wallet. \n For example, the “BTCUSD Quarterly 0925” Futures Contracts expire on the Friday of the corresponding three-month period, 25 September 2020 at 08:00:00 UTC. Settlement fee is charged the same as taker fee for all positions settled on the delivery date. \n Quarterly Futures on Binance are cash-delivered contracts, also known as cash settlement. When the contract is due, buyers and sellers do not exchange the underlying asset directly. Instead, the Futures exchange delivers all open positions at a settlement price (index-based last-hour moving average price). \n Should we offer more Quarterly Futures Contracts for trading, we will make an official announcement in advance. \n Binance Futures uses “contract” as a standardized size unit when describing a contract’s position size. For example, below are ten BTCUSD Quarterly 0925 contracts long and 20 BTCUSD Quarterly 0925 contracts short. \n The contract multiplier represents the value of a contract. Each Quarterly contract represents 100 USD. For example, the positions above show 1,000 USD of BTCUSD Quarterly 0925 long (100 USD x 10 contracts) and 2,000 USD of BTCUSD Quarterly 0925 short (100 USD x 20 contracts). Meanwhile, for Altcoin contracts, the multiplier is 10 USD. \n Notional value is the contract value of a utures contract. For instance, the notional value of BTCUSD Quarterly 0925 is denominated in BTC. \n The contract’s notional value is calculated by multiplying the contract unit by the contract multiplier and divided by mark price. Binance Futures uses the notional value to calculate the required margin, trading fee, delivery fee, and PNL. \n For example, the notional value of BTCUSD Quarterly 0925 long is \n (Contract Size x Contract Multiplier) / Mark Price \n = (10 Contracts x 100 USD) / 10,104 USD \n = 0.09897 BTC (seeimage taken) \n Realized PNL refers to profits and losses incurred from completed trade transactions. Unrealized PNL refers to profits and losses associated with transactions not yet completed. \n For example, when User A opens 10 contracts of BTCUSD Quarterly 0925 long, the unrealized PNL would be 0.0007 BTC. Once User A closed the position, User A is said to have earned 0.0007 BTC of realized PNL. \n Unrealized PNL (BTC) \n = Contract Size x Contract Multiplier x (1 / Entry Price - 1 / Mark Price) \n = 10 Contracts x 100 USD x (1 / 10,104 USD - 1 / 10,175.8 USD) \n = 0.0007 BTC \n For more contract specifications, please refer to the Contract Specifications of Quarterly Futures Contract. \n For further information on Binance’s Quarterly Futures, our Academy explains more: Quarterly Futures: What Are They And How To Trade Them? \n Risk Warning: Futures trading carries substantial risk. While there is the potential for significant profits, losses can also be substantial too. \n "

        "answer": "Asset Conversion is a function that allows traders to convert Coin A into Coin B directly in the Coin-Margined futures Wallet. With this function, you are no longer required to transfer Coin A out of your Futures Wallet to convert them into Coin B in the Spot market, saving you time and hassles. For instance, suppose you own Bitcoin but would like to open a position in an ETH-margined contract. To do so, you can simply convert your Bitcoin to Ethereum all within the comfort of your Coin-Margined Futures wallet.  \n  \n The Asset Conversion function is available on the Binance website and App (Andriod 1.29, iOS2.18 or above). \n Method 1: On your Coin-M Futures trading interface, locate the [Asset] module at the bottom right corner and click [Convert]. \n Method 2: On your Coin-Margined Futures Wallet page, the [Convert] option is on the top right corner of the page. \n Method 1:  For Android mobile devices, tap on the [Wallet] tab on the bottom menu. Select [Futures] and tap [COIN-M]. The Asset conversion function will be shown in the screenshot below.  \n Method 2: For iOS mobile devices, you can access the asset conversion function in your Coin-Margined Futures Wallet or on the trading interface. Tap on the [Convert] icon to start converting. \n Please note that the real-time exchange rate automatically refreshes every 10 seconds, please confirm your order within the time limit, or the amount you could get will be recalculated. If the latest exchange rate and the displayed exchange rate have deviated excessively during the conversion, your request might fail to process. \n "

For example, if the BTCUSD contract position is 300 BTC, the Maintenance Amount would be 11.605 BTC. \n Maintenance Margin = Position Notional * Maintenance Margin Rate on the level of position notional -  Maintenance Amount on the level of position notional \n For example, you have 100 BTCUSDT Perpetual contracts, and the latest Mark Price is 25,000 USDT. The position’s notional value is calculated as 100 * 100 / 25,000 = 0.4 BTC, which is in margin level 1. Thus, you can calculate the corresponding Maintenance Margin Rate and Maintenance Amount and substitute in the above formula: \n Maintenance Margin = 100 * 100 / 25,000 * 0.4% - 0 = 0.0016 BTC \n "

        "answer_tittle": "Why wasn’t my order filled?",
        "answer": "Here are some possible reasons for order failure when trading on Binance Futures. \n You have other open orders that share the same margin, or the order amount exceeds the position amount. This means you need to add more margin to open the position. The lower the leverage, the higher the required margin balance. You can reduce the leverage before placing the order again. \n When placing an order, its essential to consider the maximum position limit determined by the symbol and leverage. The trading rules specify each symbols maximum notional value and available leverage. If the position’s notional value you’re trying to open exceeds the limits, it will be rejected.  \n Please note that position limits vary by symbol and the chosen leverage. You should stay within this limit to ensure your orders can be successfully executed. \n Please refer to USDⓈ-Margined Futures Contract Specifications for the minimum notional value.  \n When you select the reduce only option, your order may be rejected due to two reasons: \n Your order may fail to be submitted successfully during periods of high traffic volumes. If that occurs, you will see the following message: “We are experiencing high traffic volumes. You may try to submit your order again. \n FOK order placement can fail if they cannot be filled immediately. If this happens, you will receive the following message (and the order will not be recorded in the order history): “Due to the order not being filled immediately, the FOK order has been rejected.” \n Post-Only order placement can fail if it cannot be executed as a maker order. If this happens, you will receive the following message (and the order will not be recorded in the order history): “Due to the order not being executed as a maker, the Post Only order will be rejected. The order will not be recorded in the order history”. \n The maximum number of open orders for each USDⓈ-M symbol is limited to 200, including open conditional orders. If you exceed this limit, you won’t be able to place new orders. \n You can only open a maximum of 10 conditional orders per symbol on USDⓈ-M Futures at any given time, including Stop, Stop Market, Take Profit, Take Profit Market, and Trailing Stop orders.  \n Under highly illiquid market conditions, market orders may not be fully executed or expire when the Market Order Price Cap/Floor Ratio surpasses a specific threshold (PERCENT_PRICE filter limit). The system will reject any outstanding market orders, and you will see an error message stating that the counterpartys best price falls outside the PERCENT_PRICE filter limit. \n Note: \n The market price does not meet your set price. If you place a Stop-limit order, when the market price hits the trigger price, your order will be added to the market depth pool and filled when the set price is reached. If you place a Stop Market order, you can set the trigger price at the mark price or the latest price so it will more likely be filled. \n There are no matching orders in the market depth pool at the price you set. Or your position is very large and could only be partially filled. \n For Stop Limit and Stop Market orders, you need to fill in a trigger price and a filled price. The system will then execute double margin checks before placing an order and before filling the order. Once the order is triggered, the system will conduct a second margin check immediately. If your margin balance is insufficient (e.g., you transferred some of the margin balance out of the Futures account), the order status will be shown as expired. \n "

        "answer": "Tutorial Video \n Price Protection protects your open orders from extreme market movements and abnormal trading activities. For instance, when the Last price and the Mark Price of a Futures contract exceeds a predetermined threshold that could potentially trigger a stop-loss/take-profit order, the Price Protection function will prevent the stop-loss/take-profit order from being triggered.  \n You can enable/disable the Price Protection function for individual order. You’ll only see the Price Protection function on the trading interface when it’s activated. Please note that orders placed via API won’t be affected by the Price Protection function. \n You can view the Price Protection threshold in Trading Rules. \n Let’s assume the current BTCUSDT price is at 25,000 USDT. You decide to set up a limit buy order at 25,500 USDT and schedule a take-profit market order to sell when the price reaches the Mark Price (26,000 USDT) to secure profit. \n The buy limit order will be triggered when the Last Price reaches 25,500 USDT, while the take-profit order will be triggered when the Mark Price reaches 26,000 USDT. \n *Last Price is the latest transaction price, while the Mark Price represents a calculated average, factoring in recent prices and market specifics, such as the spot price and the funding rate. For more details, please refer to What Is the Difference Between a Futures Contract’s Last Price and Mark Price?. \n Now the BTCUSDT price reaches 25,500 USDT. Extreme volatility in the market causes a substantial divergence between the Last Price (25,500 USDT) and the Mark Price (27,125 USDT), an approximately 6.5% increase from the Last Price. \n Price Protection is a valuable tool in many trading scenarios, but like all trading tools, its effectiveness depends on the traders goals, strategy, and market conditions. Here are some considerations: \n Pros: \n Cons: \n While Price Protection can be a helpful feature to protect against extreme market anomalies, you should use it judiciously and in alignment with your overall trading strategy. \n Price Protection is available on the Binance website, App, and API. You can apply it to all order types and enable/disable it anytime. \n If you want to activate Price Protection for both USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures, youll need to configure it individually on their respective trading interfaces. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and click the [Settings] icon on the upper right corner. \n 2. Click [Price Protection]. \n 3. Toggle the button to enable/disable it. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and go to [Futures]. Tap [...] - [Preferences].  \n 2. Tap [Price Protection]. Toggle the button to enable/disable it. \n Please note that if you’ve enabled the order confirmation function, you can enable/disable Price Protection when placing an order. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What factors can cause slippage in crypto markets?",
        "answer": "Slippage is the difference between a trades expected or requested price and the price at which the trade is effectively executed. It typically occurs in markets experiencing high volatility or low liquidity.  \n The slippage percentage quantifies a given assets price fluctuation between the order placement and execution. Crypto markets can be highly volatile, with significant price fluctuations in short periods, which could be prone to price slippage. \n Slippage usually occurs due to two main reasons: \n 1. Low or lack of liquidity on an exchange \n Suppose you place a large market buy order of 100 BTC for $20,000 per BTC on an exchange with low liquidity. A lack of liquidity means that your whole order cant be filled at the price you want. Some of your orders will have to be matched with sell orders above $20,000 to be 100% executed.  \n For example:  \n Your average price will be $20,000.75, which is higher than the original order amount ($20,000), with a negative slippage of $0.75. \n 2. High Volatility  \n Due to high volatility, slippage can arise when the market price shifts post-order placement. Suppose you want to place the same market buy order as in our previous example (buying 100 BTC for $20,000 per BTC). \n At the order placement time, BTC bid/ask prices are posted as $19,990.50/$20,000 on the order book. \n In volatile markets, price fluctuations can happen quickly, even within the few seconds required to fill an order. Besides, the order can impact the market by providing information that high-frequency traders can take advantage of when frontrunning.  \n In the example, high volatility in the BTC market incurs a fast price shift caused by high-frequency trades before the order gets filled. This results in the bid/ask prices changing to $20,000.5/$20,001. The order is then filled at $20,001, incurring an extra cost of $1 per BTC for a total of $100 negative slippage on the 100 BTC order. \n A market order is to buy or sell a stock at the markets current, best-available price. It aims to ensure an orders execution but offers no guarantee to fill at a specified price. Price fluctuation occurring after you place the order can affect its execution price. \n A limit order, however, will only fill at a requested price. This means you will trade your asset only at your requested price rather than a price set by the market. Note that this doesnt guarantee your whole order will fill at your requested price, and only a partial amount may be executed. \n As slippage commonly happens when volatility is high and liquidity is low, trading on exchanges with low liquidity may increase your exposure to potential slippage. Using high-volume exchanges with deeper liquidity may help mitigate that risk. Likewise, trading during low volatility periods will reduce the likelihood of unfulfilled/partially filled orders at the initial set price.  \n Slippage tolerance is the maximum percentage price difference youre willing to accept before your order stops filling or is canceled. Exchanges often integrate this feature as a way for traders to hedge themselves against significant price changes in the market when they place orders. \n Slippage tolerances features are typically available in decentralized exchanges (DEX), where slippage occurs more frequently.  \n You can customize your slippage tolerance when you trade on the USDⓈ-M Lite Trading Mode or Margin Lite Trading Mode on the Binance App. \n Large orders are more prone to slippage risks given the typically increased latency of their execution and their need to absorb more liquidity. Instead of placing a large bulk order, spreading its execution over time and across exchanges gradually can effectively cope with slippage risks. You can also use Algorithmic Trading Strategies (ATS) like Volume Participation (VP) and Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) to help efficiently execute your orders and avoid slippage in the same manner.  \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is Spread Arbitrage? ",
        "answer": "The Spread Arbitrage section on Binance Futures provides you with the relevant arbitrage information about Quarterly Futures Contracts and their spot equivalents in the market.  \n Also known as “Calendar Spread Arbitrage,” Spread Arbitrage is a common hedging technique that uses deltas in extrinsic value between 2 distinct expiration contracts of the same token to generate a profit. \n The Futures price reflects the market sentiment of the subject’s price. In the Futures market, a different settlement time contract of the same token will differ. For example, at writing time, the Mark Price of the quarterly contract is USD 10,033.3, while that of the bi-weekly contract is USD 9,973.88. \n Delivery Futures contracts with different expiry dates (e.g., BTCUSDT Quarterly 220930 and BTCUSDT Quarterly 221230) will almost always show different prices.  \n The Futures prices of a given asset reflect the market sentiment toward its Spot price. Unlike Perpetual Futures contracts with no expiry dates, Delivery Futures contracts always converge with Spot prices at expiration dates. \n This convergence allows you to identify and anticipate Delivery Futures price trends while taking advantage of the spread between Spot and Futures contracts of the same asset with different expiries to make profits. \n The “Spread” refers to the difference between the price of an asset in the Spot market and its quarterly equivalent (e.g., BTCUSDT Quarterly 220930 - BTC/USDT) or between the prices of its quarterlies with different expiries (e.g., BTCUSDT Quarterly 221230 - BTCUSDT Quarterly 220930).Spread Arbitrage describes a delta-neutral strategy consisting of taking two opposite positions on contracts with different expiries (spot-futures or futures-futures) while collecting their spread at a given time.  \n Go to Binance Futures and click [Information] - [Arbitrage Data]. Then, click [Spread Arbitrage] above the table. \n Examples of Spread Arbitrage strategies on Binance Futures \n Binance Futures displays the arbitrage data for USDⓈ-M and Coin-M contracts, covering two types of Spread Arbitrage: Spot-Derivatives and Derivatives-Derivatives arbitrages. \n Let’s take DOT Spot and Quarterly contracts as an example: \n For Spot-Derivatives portfolios, Spread Rate = (Futures Price - Spot Price) / Spot Price= (6.424 - 6.45) / 6.45 = -0.4 % (at the time of trading) \n Since the Spread Rate is negative, you sell it on the Spot market (i.e., DOT/USD) and buy a long quarterly contract (i.e., DOTUSD Quarterly 220930): \n  \n Let’s assume the DOT Spot Price drops by 10% from its initial price on 220930 at the expiry time of 08:00 (UTC): \n Estimated Revenue = | Current Spread Rate | * Position Size (USDT) \n  \n Now let’s assume the DOT Spot Price increases by 10% from its initial price on 220930 at expiry time 08:00 (UTC): \n  \n Let’s take BCH quarterly contracts as an example: \n For Derivatives-Derivatives portfolios, Spread Rate = (Longer-Term Contract Price - Near-Term Contract Price) / Near-Term Contract Price = (107.61 - 109.58) / 109.58 = -1.7978% (at the time of trading) \n Unlike perpetual contracts, quarterly contracts will converge with the Spot Price at their respective expiries. The spread will narrow as both the near-term and the longer-term contract price will converge toward the Spot Price. \n Let’s assume both contract prices drop by 10% from their initial price at their respective expiry times: \n Now let’s assume both contract prices increase by 10% from their initial price at their respective expiry times: \n You can adjust the USDT position size used to calculate the estimated revenue for USDⓈ-M and Coin-M trading pairs arising from Spread Arbitrage.  \n The [Portfolio] column indicates the direction of the arbitraging trades between Quarterly Futures and Spot or between Quarterly Futures with different prices and expiries.  \n You can click the contract links or the [Trade] button on the right to access the corresponding trading interfaces for both markets and start arbitraging with order placements. \n Based on the Spread Rate sign (positive or negative), the [Portfolio] column will display arbitrage trade directions of a given trading pair as per the following: \n An estimation of the revenue generated by the selected position size when employing the corresponding arbitrage strategy, taking the current Spread Rate as a reference. \n The difference between the prices of the two contracts is considered part of the arbitrage strategy. \n The Annual Percentage Rate generated by extrapolating the Spread Rate to a year. \n Coin-M APR = | Current Spread Rate | * 365 / Max Period (in days)  USDⓈ-M APR = | Current Spread Rate | * 365 / Max Period (in days) / 2 \n *Max Period less than 1 day will be calculated as 1 day \n Arbitrage traders will collect the estimated revenue at the end of the Max Period.  \n The current cost of borrowing the corresponding asset. \n The interest rate of the crypto is based on your Binance VIP level.

        "answer_tittle": "What is Funding Rate? ",
        "answer": "Funding Rate Arbitrage provides users with relevant arbitrage information about Perpetual Futures Contracts and their spot equivalents in the market.  \n The Funding Rate is primarily used to force convergence of prices between the Perpetual Contract and the underlying asset. \n It is a periodic payment made either by short to long traders or by long to short traders, and it is calculated based on the difference between the perpetual contract prices and spot prices. In an uptrend, the Funding Rate is positive and tends to rise over time. During these periods, traders who are long on a Perpetual Contract pay a funding fee to traders on the opposing side.  \n Conversely, the Funding Rate is negative during bearish markets, which means traders who are short on a Perpetual Contract pay a funding fee to long traders. \n You can refer to the Funding Rates FAQ for a detailed overview. \n Funding Rate Arbitrage is a delta neutral strategy that enables traders to hedge their position in the Futures Market by taking an opposite position for the same trading pair in the Spot Market. Any loss originating from a price movement on the Futures Market will be offset by a profit on the Spot Market (and vice versa), which allows traders to earn funding fees without closing any of their positions.  \n For instance, a trader holding a short BTCBUSD position in the Futures Market can buy BTC in the Spot Market of an equivalent value to hedge his position against price volatility and collect funding fees. \n To view the Funding Rates Arbitrage data, go to Binance Futures and click [Information] - [Arbitrage Data]. Then, click [Funding Rate Arbitrage] above the table. You can also access the Funding Rates Arbitrage data directly here. \n 1. Position Size - You can adjust the USDT position size, which is used to calculate the estimated 3 Day Revenue for USDⓈ-M and COIN-M trading pairs, respectively. \n 2. Portfolio - The Portfolio column indicates the direction of the trades for arbitraging between Futures and Spot.  \n You can click both links to quickly access the corresponding trading interfaces for both markets and start arbitraging with order placements. \n Based on the Funding Rate sign (positive or negative), the Portfolio column will display Arbitrage trade directions of a given trading pair as per the following: \n Positive cumulative Funding Rate: short perpetual contract, buy on spot. \n Negative cumulative Funding Rate: buy long perpetual contract, sell on spot. \n Please note that you can choose a display based either on the 3 Day Cumulative Funding Rate or on the Next Funding Rate by selecting the corresponding option.  \n 3. Funding Rates - Provides a comparative overview of the Funding Rates overtime for a given perpetual contract. \n You can also choose to display/hide the 7 Day Cumulative Funding Rate and 30 Day Cumulative Funding Rate by ticking or unticking the corresponding boxes. \n 4. Estimated 3 Day Revenue - An estimation of the revenue generated by the selected position size taking the previous 3 Day Funding Rates as reference. \n Taking the above Position Size as an example, the estimated 3 Day Revenue based on the corresponding Cumulative Funding Rate (0,0551%) is 2,758.35 USDT. \n *Notice that the Estimated 3 Day Revenue for USDⓈ-M Futures is divided by 2 based on the assumption that position size is in USDT, which needs to be divided equally into spot and futures investments. \n 5. APR - The Annual Rate generated by extrapolating the Funding Rate to a year. \n *Notice that the APR for USDⓈ-M Futures is divided by 2 based on the assumption that position size is in USDT, which needs to be divided equally into spot and futures investments. \n 6. Spread Rate - The spread between the perpetual contract and the mark price. \n Spread Rate = (The last price of the sell pair - the last price of the buy pair) / the last price of the buy pair \n In periods of high volatility, the price between the perpetual contract and the mark price may diverge. In such instances, the premium increases or decreases accordingly.  \n Example:  \n Last price BTCUSDT pair : 30,560 USDT \n Last price BTC/USDT pair : 30,570 USDT \n Spread rate = (30,560 - 30,570) / 30,560 = -0,033% \n 7. Open Interest - Total number of outstanding perpetual futures contracts that have not yet been settled. \n 8. Time to Next Settlement - The time left before Funding Fees Payments and Funding Rate expiration. \n Settlement information for each Futures Contract is displayed on the Real-Time Funding Rate Tab.  \n 9. Action - Allows traders to quickly navigate to Perpetual or Spot Markets on Binance via the “Trade” button. \n  \n "

        "answer": "The Liquidity Analysis section can be visualized by eligible high-frequency trading users who enrolled in the Futures Liquidity Provider Program. The new tool displays customized charts (Cost To Trade, Bid-Ask Spread, Book Depth) for selected USDⓈ-M Futures and COIN-M Futures trading pairs available on Binance Futures. \n You can access the Liquidity Analysis section in Binance Futures by clicking [Derivatives] - [Derivatives Portal] - [Analytics] - [Market Liquidity]. \n  \n Cost To Trade is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is fully executed. It can result from two events such as a change in the Bid-Ask Spread between the time a trade is placed and when the trade is filled, or when the order Book Depth is insufficient and cannot support large market orders.  \n Simulating Cost To Trade before executing a trade is important in cryptocurrency markets and should be incorporated into strategy backtesting. It is worth noting that Cost To Trade is measured in the quote asset of the contract. \n The Cost To Trade is not calculated if there is an insufficient number of orders in the Order Book. \n At 04-18 12:57, the Cost To Trade 1 BTCUSDT USD-Margined contract (short) was 0.95 USDT (Quote Asset) (daily view) \n At 04-18 12:56, the Cost To Trade 1 AVAXUSD Coin-M contract (long) was 0.011125 USD (Quote Asset) (daily view) \n A Bid-Ask Spread is the amount by which the Ask Price exceeds the Bid Price. It is calculated for all levels of the Order Book (from 1 to 10), where the Spread is measured in ticks and bps. \n If either the Ask Price or the Bid Price is not available at any level of the Order Book, the Spread will not be calculated. \n The Bid-Ask Spread chart can be adjusted to see levels ranging from the Top of the Books to the Top 10 Levels depending on your visualization preference. \n At 04-19 12:28, the Bid-Ask Spread for BTCUSDT UM contract was 1 Tick at the Top of the Book, 11,67 Ticks at Level 2 of the Order Book, and 57,78 at Level 10 of the Order Book (daily view, base unit in Ticks, Top 10 Levels adjusted View) \n At 04-19 12:01, the Bid-Ask Spread for the ETHUSD CM contract was 0,00000082 bps at the Top of the Book, 0,00000884 bps at Level 2 of the Order Book, and 0,00002205 bps at Level 4 of the Order Book (daily view, base unit in bps, Top 4 Levels adjusted View) \n Market Depth is the cumulative sum of all bids and asks on an Order Book snapshot at different intervals from the mid price. Aggregated Market Depth is derived directly from raw Order Book snapshots. The deeper an Order Book, the larger the quantity of bids and asks on either side of the mid price.  \n Generally, deeper Order Books indicate that a market is more liquid and can support bigger market orders.  \n Binance Futures currently provides aggregated depth for both the bid side and the ask side at the following ranges from the mid price: 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5%.  \n At 04-18 14:25, the Book Depth for the BTCBUSD UM contract was Bid 324 / Ask 298 at the top of the Order Book (weekly view, base asset quantity, Top 1% Levels adjusted View)  \n At 04-18 03:31, an overview of the Book Depth for ETHUSD CM contract at the top 5 Levels of the Order Book (weekly view, notional amount) \n "

        "answer": "Binance Futures has launched the Futures position limit adjustment tool. You can now visit the position limit page to increase or decrease your position limit manually.  \n To maintain system security and stability, our system sets a max position for different leverages.  \n For example, when you trade BNBUSDT and select 20x, the max position you can hold is 250,000 USDT. Higher leverage results in a lower max position and vice-versa.  \n You can adjust it from [Preference] - [Position Limit Enlarge]. \n Alternatively, you can access it via [Leverage] - [Adjust Margin] - [Position Limit Enlarge]. \n You can also access it via [Trading Rules] - [Leverage & Margin] - [Position Limit Enlarge]. \n For App users, go to [Futures] - [...] - [Position Limit Adjustment]. \n Your maximum position increase ratio is based on a trading score generated from your past trading behavior. For example, if your maximum position increase ratio is 50%, it means you can open 150% of the default position after increasing your position limit.  \n Click [Increase] and select the symbol you want to adjust. Click [Confirm]. Your position limit increase will take effect immediately. Please note that you need to manually adjust each symbol.  \n To view your position limit details, go to [Position Limit Adjustment Data] - [My Adjustment].  \n The system will automatically evaluate your trading risk and generate a comprehensive score based on your past trading volume, maker order volume, leverage, and open interest. Your maximum adjustable ratio will be automatically updated based on your score. You can check the ratio from the position limit adjustment page on the first day of each month. \n Max adjustable ratio by default = Max adjustable ratio of the account ranked 3rd quartile* in terms of trading performance among the user’s active Futures accounts over the past 180 days \n For example, User A has 100 active futures trading sub-accounts in the past 180 days. The newly opened sub-account’s maximum adjustable ratio by default will be equal to the #25 best-performing sub-account’s maximum adjustable ratio. \n Max adjustment ratio by default = max (current existing sub-account performance rating, 3rd quartile ranked account performance among the user’s active Futures accounts over past 180 days) \n Let’s take User A as an example: \n *3rd quartile = The middle value between the median and the highest performing sub-accounts among a user’s active Futures sub-accounts over the past 180 days. The system sorts sub-accounts by performance, e.g., if a user has 100 sub-accounts, the accounts will be ranked from top performing to the lowest performing, with the top-performing sub-account as #1 and the lowest as #100. Then, sub-account #25 will be the 3rd quartile. \n Position limit increase fee for USDⓈ-M Futures:  \n Position limit increase fee for COIN-M Futures:  \n Once your position limit increase is confirmed, the fee will be automatically deducted from your USDⓈ-M Wallet or COIN-M Wallet on the first day of each month. The adjusted fee for the first month will be prorated based on the remaining days of the month, and the fee will be deducted immediately. If you cancel the service in the same month, your fee will not be refunded. \n For example, for USDⓈ-M Futures, if you increase the BNBUSDT position limit on November 10th, the prorated fee of (20/30) * 20 = 13.3 USDT will be deducted on November 10th. If the position limit is not reduced before December 1st, 20 USDT will be deducted on December 1st. \n For COIN-M Futures, if you increase the BNBUSD position limit on November 10th, assuming the BNBUSD last index price from the previous day is 200 USD, the prorated fee of (20/30) * (20/200) = 0.06666666 BNB will be deducted on November 10th. If the position limit is not reduced before December 1st, (30/200) = 0.15 BNB will be deducted on December 1st. \n You can update your position limits from the position limit adjustment page. \n To adjust your sub-account position limit, go to the position limit adjustment page. You may select any of the associated sub-accounts (including virtual accounts) by simply scrolling down through the [Select Account] drop-down. \n If you wish to adjust your master account’s position limit, follow the same process without selecting any account (you may skip this step). \n Binance reserves the right to revoke your application and to retract the adjustment if: \n Please note that if you fail to adhere to the stipulated conditions, Binance maintains the right to withhold any refunds associated with your position limit increase fee. \n "

        "answer": "In Futures trading, you can trade with leverage and are only required to fund the initial margin to open positions in a futures contract. It is a critical feature that makes the Futures market attractive, as it allows you to profit from relatively small changes in price movement. Leverage can potentially magnify your profits or losses by the same magnitude. \n Futures exchanges have established various risk management mechanisms to protect highly leveraged traders from incurring significant losses. One of which is liquidation, a risk control feature that prevents traders from falling into negative equity. \n In volatile markets, leveraged positions are prone to price gaps and may cause a trader’s equity to plunge into negative territory instantaneously. In these situations, losses can exceed the maintenance margin. \n Heres an example of how it plays out in real life: \n Consider two traders, Alice and Bob, both initiated opposing positions in BTC/USDT perpetual futures worth 1 BTC with 20x leverage. Both Alice and Bob have a wallet balance of 5,000 USDT each. Table 1 describes the details of their respective positions. \n Table 1 - Position details of Alice and Bob \n  \n Let’s assume a 10% fall in BTC/USDT perpetual prices to $49,500. In this scenario, Alice incurs a loss of $5,500 in her long trade, while Bob profits $5,500 on his short trade. The consequent events are as follows: \n In a volatile market, it is extremely difficult to ensure that the losing positions are liquidated precisely at their liquidation price. Furthermore, liquidating beyond the bankruptcy price would mean that Bob receives fewer profits and Alice would incur more losses. \n To prevent these occurrences, exchanges tend to liquidate the losing positions at a price better than the liquidation price. \n In cases where an exchange is unable to liquidate positions before a trader reaches negative equity, the following methods will be used to cover the losses of bankrupt positions: \n  \n "

        "answer": "To avoid liquidation, you need to pay close attention to your Futures Margin Ratio. When your margin ratio reaches 100%, some, if not all, of your positions will be liquidated.  \n The margin ratio is calculated as maintenance margin divided by margin balance. \n Therefore, if your margin balance drops below the maintenance margin rate - the exchange will liquidate your positions. \n In case of a price drop, please ensure that you have enough margin balance in your futures account. The higher the margin balance you have, the lower the liquidation price. \n You can use the Binance Futures Liquidation price calculator to calculate how increasing your wallet balance will lower the liquidation price. \n A Stop-loss order is a conditional order that is executed at a specified price after a given stop price has been reached. Once the stop price is reached, it will buy or sell at the market/limit price depending on your order parameters. \n A stop-loss is designed to limit an investors loss on a position that makes an unfavorable move. For instance, you set up a 20% stop loss from your entry price. \n Assume your entry order was executed at $40,000. The stop-loss order will be triggered when the price drops -20% from $40,000. \n By setting a stop-loss function, you can exit a losing position earlier and avoid getting liquidated. \n Let’s consider this scenario. Assume you have a wallet balance of 500 USDT. You entered a long BTCUSDT position worth 1,000 USDT with 20x leverage at $50,000. In this example, your liquidation price will be $25,100.40. \n Now assume that BTCUSDT’s price falls 10% to $45,000. At this point, you decided to add on to your losing position and entered another long BTCUSDT position worth 1000 USDT with 20x leverage at $45,000. Adjusting to your newest position, the liquidation price is now $35,857.67. \n As shown, adding more contracts to a losing position will increase your liquidation price of the entire position. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "Example trading strategy using Hedge Mode",
        "answer": "Hedge mode is a trading strategy used by futures traders to mitigate their risk exposure to the market. It involves opening two opposite positions, a long and a short, to profit from any market movement while minimizing potential losses. \n In One-way Mode, you can only hold positions in one direction under one contract.  \n For example, if you open a short position and anticipate that the price will go down in the longer time frame, but you also want to open a long position for a shorter time frame. you won’t be able to open positions in both directions at the same time. Opening positions in both directions would cancel one another out or reduce their sizes. \n In Hedge Mode, you can simultaneously hold positions in both long and short directions under the same contract.  \n For example, you can hold both long and short positions in the BTCUSDT contract at the same time. \n 1. Open the trading interface and click [USDⓈ-M] or [COIN-M] on the top navigation bar.2. On the top right, click the [Parameters] icon, then select [Preference], and click [Position Mode]. \n 3. Select either [One-Way Mode] or [Hedge Mode].  \n 4. A pop-up window will appear in the lower right corner of the screen once the Position Mode is successfully adjusted.  \n Lets say you want to invest in BTCUSDT but are unsure about the markets direction. You can enable Hedge Mode to help mitigate your risk. \n In this example, you open a 1 BTC long position and a 0.5 BTC short position in BTCUSDT. If the market moves in either direction, you will have a position that profits from that move. \n If the BTCUSDT price goes up from 22,000 USDT to 24,000 USDT. The net profit of your long and short position would be (1-0.5)*2,000 = 1,000 USDT. \n On the other hand, if BTCUSDT goes down from 22000 USDT to 19000 USDT. The net profit of your long and short position would be (1-0.5)*(-3,000) = -1,500 USDT. However, this loss is significantly less than if you had only opened a long position 1*(-3,000)=-3,000 USDT and the market had gone against you. \n By using hedge mode, you have reduced your risk and minimized potential losses. This is because your short position helps offset any losses from your long position.  \n Please note that the following trading strategy example is for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to be taken as financial or investment advice.  \n Binance does not endorse or guarantee any specific trading strategy or outcome and will not be held responsible for any losses or damages that may result from using this example as guidance for your own trading activities. \n "

Post Only Order \n 7. Limit TP/SL Order (Strategy Order) \n 8. Reverse Order \n 9. Scaled Order \n A limit order allows you to place an order at a specific or a better price. A buy limit order will be filled if the price matches or is lower than your limit price, while a sell limit order will be filled at or higher than your limit price. Please note that a limit order does not guarantee to execute. \n Market orders are matched immediately at the best available price. They take prices from limit orders on the order book to execute. Therefore, slippage could occur when you get a price different from what you expected. \n A stop limit order is a conditional order over a set timeframe, executed at a specified price after a given stop price has been reached. Once the stop price is reached, it will buy or sell at the limit price or a better price than the limit price you set. \n Similar to a stop limit order, a stop market order uses a stop price to trigger the trade. However, when the stop price is reached, it’d trigger a market order. \n A trailing stop order allows traders to place a pre-set order at a specific percentage away from the market price when the market swings. It locks in profit by enabling a trade to remain open and continue to profit as long as the price is moving in the favorable direction.  \n Please note that a trailing stop order does not move back in the other direction. When the price moves in the opposite direction by a specified percentage, it will be executed at market price. \n When you place a post only order, it will be added to the order book, but won’t be executed immediately. The post only order will exist as a maker order to add liquidity to the order book. \n When you open a Futures position, you can check the box next to [TP/SL] to set a take profit or stop loss price. Depending on your trading strategy, you can also set your order to be triggered based on the Last Price or the Mark Price. \n A reverse order involves simultaneously closing an existing open position and opening a position of equal size in the opposite direction. It is executed through market orders.  \n Reverse orders allow you to quickly react to market shifts by effectively “reversing” your current market stance. \n A scaled order automatically generates multiple limit orders within a specified price range. This order type is beneficial for managing large order quantities. It splits the order amount into several suborders and places them separately without significantly impacting the market. Scaled orders are often used to achieve a better average price when starting or closing a position. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is a stop order?",
        "answer": "A stop order on Binance Futures is a combination of stop-loss and take-profit orders. The system will decide if an order is a stop-loss order or a take-profit order based on the price level of trigger price against the Last Price or Mark Price when the order is placed. \n Example 1: \n User A places a trigger price order based on the last price.  \n As the trigger price (8,700 USDT) is lower than the last price, the order will be placed as a take profit order. You can check the order placed under [Open Order].  \n Example 2: \n User A places a trigger price order based on the mark price.  \n As the trigger price (8,828 USDT) is lower than the mark price, the order will be placed as a “Stop Market Order”. You can check the order placed under [Open Order].  \n Let’s say a user holds a long ETHUSDT Futures position and sets a take profit sell order that will trigger if the mark price is greater than or equal to $2,000.05.  \n The price precision for ETHUSDT is 0.01. Truncating down to this precision will determine whether the stop order should be activated.  \n If the mark price reaches $2,000.048914224, the truncated price will be $2,000.04. This is below the trigger price of $2,000.05, which won’t trigger the take profit order. If the mark price increases to $2,000.05000001, the mark price is truncated down to $2,000.05. This matches the trigger price, and as a result, the take profit order is triggered.  \n Let’s take another example where the user holds a short STMXUSDT position and places a take profit buy order that will trigger if the mark price is less than or equal to $0.00666. STMXUSDTs price precision is 0.00001, so the mark price is truncated down to this precision to determine if the stop order will trigger.  \n If the mark price reaches $0.006670234, the truncated price of $0.00667 is still higher than the trigger price of $0.00666. As a result, the take profit order will remain inactive. If the mark price drops to $0.00666999, the truncated price will equal the trigger price of $0.00666, thereby activating the take profit order. \n Important Notes: \n Binance uses the mark price as a trigger for liquidation and to measure unrealized profit and loss.  \n The mark price is generally a few cents from the last price. However, the last price might deviate dramatically and significantly from the mark price during extreme price movements. Hence, please monitor the price difference between last price and mark price. You can always cancel the order you have placed and replace the order if you would like to change the trigger from mark price to last price, or vice versa.  \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is a trailing stop order?",
        "answer": "A trailing stop order is a type of order that helps traders limit their losses and protect their gains when the market swings. It places a pre-set order at a specific percentage away from the market price, allowing traders to lock in profits as the price moves in their favor. \n When the market price moves favorably, the trailing stop order moves with it, maintaining the specified percentage or amount away from the market price. This allows traders to keep their position open and continue to profit as long as the price moves in a favorable direction. \n However, if the market price moves in the opposite direction by a specified percentage, the trailing stop order will close/exit the trade at the market price. This helps to limit losses and protect gains by closing the trade when the price moves against the trader. \n Its important to note that the trailing stop order does not move back in the other direction. Therefore, traders need to set their trailing stop order at a level that reflects their risk tolerance and market conditions. Additionally, trailing stop orders can be placed as reduce-only orders to decrease or close an open position. \n As a trader, you can place a trailing stop order when entering a position initially. However, this is not a common practice among traders. Typically, traders use trailing stop orders to manage their risk and protect their gains after theyve opened a position. \n When youre entering a long trade, you will place a sell trailing stop order above the current market price (initially). The trailing stop price moves up by a specified percentage or amount, and it will follow the market price as it moves in your favor. This means that the trailing stop price will be adjusted upwards as the market price moves up, forming a new trailing stop price. \n However, the trailing stop order will stop moving if the price moves down. A sell order will be triggered if the market price moves in the opposite direction and falls below the trailing stop price, This sell order will be executed at the next available market price, and the trade will be closed with the sell order. \n If you already have an existing long position, you would place a sell trailing stop order below the current market price. As the market price moves up, the trailing stop price will move up with it by a specified percentage or amount. If the market price moves in the opposite direction and falls below the trailing stop price, a sell order will be triggered. This sell order will be executed at the next available market price, and the trade will be closed with the sell order. \n  A buy trailing stop order is the opposite of a sell trailing stop order. \n For a short trade, when entering a position, you would place a buy trailing stop order below the current market price. The trailing stop price moves down by a specified percentage or amount, and it will follow the market price as it moves in your favor. This means that the trailing stop price will be adjusted downwards as the market price moves down, forming a new trailing stop price. \n When the price moves up, the trailing stop stops moving. If the price moves more than the predetermined callback rate from its lowest price and reaches the trailing stop price, a buy order will be placed and the trade will be closed at market price.  \n Please note that to activate a trailing stop order as a market order to exit the trade, both conditions (activation price and callback rate) must be fulfilled. \n To activate a trailing stop order, 2 conditions need to be fulfilled. \n A buy trailing stop order will be placed if the following conditions are met: \n A sell trailing stop order will be placed if the following conditions are met: \n Callback rate is the percentage of movement in the opposite direction that you are willing to tolerate. The callback rate ranges from 0.1% to 5% by placing the rate manually in the “Callback Rate” field.  \n Activation price is your desired price level that triggers the trailing stop order. If no activation price is set, the activation price will be the market price by default (either “Last Price” or “Mark Price”, subject to trigger types).  \n To place a buy trailing stop order, the activation price must be lower than the market price. Conversely, the activation price must be higher than the market price to place a sell trailing stop order. \n You can choose either “Last Price” or “Mark Price” as a trigger. If “Mark Price” is selected, when the Mark Price reaches or exceeds the activation price, the trailing stop order will be activated even though the Last Price does not reach the activation price. \n Please note that Binance uses Mark Price as a trigger for liquidation and to measure unrealized profit and loss. The Mark Price is generally similar to the Last Price, but the Last Price might deviate significantly from the Mark Price during extreme price movements. Hence, please monitor the difference between the Last Price and the Mark Price. You can always cancel the order you placed, or replace the order if you would like to change the trigger from Mark Price to Last Price or vice versa. \n Important Notes \n For a trailing stop order to be effective, a callback rate shouldn’t be too low or too high, and the activation price shouldn’t be too close or too far away from the market price. When the callback rate is too low or the activation price is too close, the trailing stop order is too close to the entry price and is easily triggered by normal market movements. There is no room for a trade to move in the favorable direction before any meaningful price movements occur. The trade will be closed/exited when the market takes a temporary dip and recover, thus resulting in a losing trade.  \n When the callback rate is too high, the trailing stop order could only be triggered by extreme market movements, leaving traders at risks of unnecessarily large losses.  \n A higher callback rate is generally a better bet during volatile periods, while a lower callback rate is preferable during normal market conditions.  \n There is no optimal callback rate or activation price. You are advised to revise their trailing stop strategy from time to time due to the constant price fluctuations in the market. You should always carefully consider whether a trade is consistent with your risk tolerance, investment experience, financial condition, and other considerations that may be relevant to you. Apart from that, always determine your callback rate and activation price based on your targeted profitability levels and acceptable losses within your capacity. \n (1) Placing a sell trailing stop order for a long trade \n The Last Price of the BTCUSDT perpetual contract is 10,000 USDT. User A places a trailing stop order as follows: \n The trailing stop price is 9,500 USDT when the last price is 10,000 USDT. A new trailing stop price is formed at 9,975 USDT [Last Price * (1 - callback rate)] when the price increases to 10,500 USDT.  \n The trailing stop price stops when the price moves down. When the price moves to its peak price at 11,000 USDT, a new trailing is formed at 10,450 USDT. When the price moves down, the trailing stop price stops again. A sell order will be executed at market price to close the position when the price moves more than 5%, reaching and exceeding the trailing stop price at 10,450 USDT.  \n The conditions are met as follows: \n Note: \n Rebound Rate = (Highest Price - Rebound Price) / Highest Price  \n = (11,000 - 10,450) / 11,000  \n = 5% \n The Last Price of the BTCUSDT perpetual contract is 10,500 USDT.

        "answer_tittle": "1. What is a scaled order?",
        "answer": "Tutorial Video \n A scaled order automatically generates multiple limit orders within a specified price range. This order type is beneficial for managing large order quantities. It splits the order amount into several suborders and places them separately without significantly impacting the market. Scaled orders are often used to achieve a better average price when starting or closing a position. \n Scaled orders benefit traders who want to avoid revealing their total order volume to the market, which is often a concern for those dealing with significant quantities of a particular asset. Revealing large orders can influence other market participants behavior and, in turn, the assets price, which might be detrimental to the traders position. \n 1. Log into your Binance account and visit the [COIN-M] or [USDⓈ-M] Futures trading interface.  \n 2. Select the contract you wish to trade. \n 3. Choose [Scaled Order] from the dropdown menu and customize the order parameters: \n Choose whether to buy or sell and click [Preview]. \n 4. You’ll see the limit suborders created based on your input. If you are satisfied with the suborders, click [Submit]. The system will batch all the suborders and send them to the matching engine. \n You can set the distribution of your scaled order to control the share of the total amount each order receives. There are four distribution types available: \n Flat: This type of distribution is the most straightforward. Each order within your total amount receives the same size. The amount distribution is uniform across all price points. You can use [Flat] when you expect the price to fluctuate within the range but have no specific bias towards it moving upwards or downwards. \n Ascending: The order size systematically grows as the price escalates. The last order is characterized by the highest price and largest quantity, resulting in more of the asset being traded at a higher price. Its commonly employed to distribute sell orders and elevate the average selling price of the order. \n Descending: The order size contracts as the price rises, and the order with the highest price will have the smallest quantity. In this case, a greater portion of the asset is traded at lower prices. Its typically used to spread out buy orders and lower the average buy price. \n Random: As suggested by its name, this distribution type randomly allocates the size of each order at every price point within a defined range. With a random distribution, youll need to enter the variance % (up to 10%). If you opt for a variance of 10%, it means the order sizes will be randomly distributed across a range with a 10% variation. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "How are market orders impacted in illiquid and volatile market conditions?",
        "answer": "To help you avoid trading at a price that is not consistent with a fair and orderly market, Binance sets price ceilings for buy market orders and price floors for sell market orders. This trading rule helps protect your orders from extreme market movements and abnormal trading activity. \n When the market is highly volatile, the bid-ask spread on the orderbook might be large, and the best bid/ask price might deviate from the contract mark price. Buy/sell market orders or Limit orders may expire or be partially filled due to the Market/Limit Order Price Cap/Floor Ratio, which is prevalent in extremely illiquid market conditions.  \n For instance, a limit order will expire if the difference between the limit order price and the mark price exceeds the Limit Order Price Cap/Floor Ratio. A buy market order will expire if the difference between the best ask price and the mark price exceeds the Market Order Price Cap/Floor Ratio. A sell market order will expire if the difference between the best bid price and the mark price exceeds the Market Order Price Cap/Floor Ratio.  \n Please be aware that in the event of extreme price movements or deviation from the price index, Binance will undertake additional protective measures, including but not limited to changing the threshold of the order price cap. \n For more details about the market and limit order price cap, please refer to the Trading Rules. \n During volatile market conditions, the price of a contract can move significantly in a short period, causing market orders to execute at an undesirable price. \n If you place market orders under these circumstances, they may expire or be partially filled due to the Market Order Price Cap/Floor Ratio, which is prevalent in extremely illiquid market conditions. Once the Market Order Price Cap/Floor Ratio exceeds the threshold, any unfilled market orders will expire. \n Although the Market Order Price Cap/Floor Ratios are set at a level intended to balance the objectives of trade certainty and minimize price risk, there is a possibility that a trade may be delayed or may not take place. In addition, please note that contracts may have varying Market Order Price Cap/Floor Ratios, which may affect the speed and certainty of trades. \n Please note that certain limit orders that exceed the Limit Order Price Cap/Floor Ratio threshold may expire or can only be partially filled. This could be due to the buy limit order being higher than the price cap, or the sell limit order being lower than the price floor. \n  \n "

        "answer": "Delisting is the removal of a listed asset from an exchange. The delisting can be voluntary or involuntary and usually happens when a project ceases operations, does not meet listing requirements, undergoes a hard fork, or splits or reverse split occasions with new coins. There are numerous factors that could go into the decision for an exchange to delist an asset. \n When an asset is delisted from an exchange, all its trading pairs will stop trading and be removed. An official announcement will be released prior to the cessation of the trading date to acknowledge all users. Users are still able to trade until the cessation of the trading date. \n During the last hour on the cessation of the trading date, the mark price of the delisted asset will be calculated as the average of the price index every second over the last hour before cessation, i.e., a total of 3,600 mark price. \n It is important to note that from 30 minutes before trading is suspended, you are not allowed to open new positions of the delisted asset. You can only close existing positions, i.e., placing reduce-only orders within 30 minutes before the cessation of trading. Binance reserves the right to suspend trading anytime (i.e., on or before 30 minutes before the effective asset delisting time). Please refer to the announcement for the exact time that trading is suspended. \n If you choose to hold the position until the cessation of trading, the position will be automatically closed or settled. Please note that trading fees will be charged for the automatic settlement. All unrealized P/L is calculated at the time of settlement and converted into realized P/L. \n You are advised to close any open positions of the delisted asset before the cessation of trading to avoid automatic settlement. \n  \n "

        "answer": "Binance BTCDOM Index is a cryptocurrency price index reflecting the market dominance performance of Bitcoin. The BTCDOM Index is a metric that traders can use to quickly get a sense of Bitcoins value relative to that of the broader cryptocurrency market.  \n Unlike the real Bitcoin market dominance indicator, which is capped within 0~100%, the BTCDOM index is uncapped and more suitable for derivatives trading. It is calculated with Bitcoin price denominated in the constituent cryptocurrency, e.g. BTC/ETH, BTC/BNB, BTC/ADA, etc. \n The BTCDOM Index provides insights into the market and can be used as a tool to speculate on Bitcoin’s relative strength against altcoins. Essentially, the index measures the demand for Bitcoin relative to altcoins. \n When altcoins gain market share relative to Bitcoin, the BTCDOM index loses value. Conversely, when Bitcoin gains market share relative to altcoins, the BTCDOM index will gain value.  \n In certain conditions, if Bitcoin falls in price, but the rest of the cryptocurrency market falls at a similar rate, then Bitcoin dominance is likely to remain the same. \n The base level is 1000. \n 3.1. Sample Universe \n The sample universe includes the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on Binance and Binance Futures excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins. \n 3.2 Constituents Selection \n All cryptocurrencies listed on Binance and Binance Futures are prioritized and ranked by market capitalization for index inclusion.  \n To review the constituents selected, click here and go to [Index], select [Symbol] - BTCDOMUSDT], select [Type] - [Price Index], scroll down and click on [Component Info].    \n The BTCDOM Index is calculated with the weighted average prices of its constituents. The price used for the BTCDOM index is different from other indices because it is calculated with Bitcoin price denominated in the constituent cryptocurrency, e.g. BTC/ETH, BTC/BNB, BTC/ADA, etc. \n The formula is: \n In which n is the constituents count, pi is the latest price of constituent i (denominated in the index denomination), wit is the weight of constituents i at the latest reported time t, Divisort is the latest stable divisor, which ensures a continuous change of index constituents/weight and the index price affected only by the constituents price change.  \n The divisor on base-day is: \n And at report time t: \n In which nt is components count at report time t, and nt-1 is the components count from previous report time. \n The weight is calculated by a weighting factor (the weight will remain unchanged between rebalances): \n The weighting methods for Binance BTCDOM Index is market cap weighting with a weighting factor calculated as follow: \n The market cap i (at rebalancing time) is the market cap of constituent i, all metrics are measured with the index denomination. \n The following table shows an example of how the BTCDOM Index is calculated: \n 5.1 Regular Rebalances \n The index constituents and their weight will be rebalanced every Thursday at 08:00:00 UTC to adapt to changes in the market. \n 5.1 Special Adjustment \n Special adjustments are deemed necessary when one or several constituents face drastic changes (e.g. delist or no organic volume). Two kinds of adjustment can occur: exclude and recalculate weight (and Divisort); and exclude and fill up with constituents from the alternate list, where recalculation is also needed. \n 5.2 Hard Fork/Airdrop/Mapping Adjustment \n The cryptocurrency price index, which is based on blockchain, will be adjusted for hard fork/airdrop/mapping following these guidelines: \n *Disclaimer: The numbers in this article are subject to change without further notice.

These rules apply to the Binance Futures trading service, which includes the trading of Futures contracts and other related products and offerings. \n 1.3. Binance Terms of Use and other relevant rules shall continue to apply. \n 2.1. You should always be aware of Futures trading risks and adjust your position(s) and margin balance(s), if any, in time to minimize that risk. All of your margin balance may be liquidated in the event of extreme price movements. Please use trading strategies at your own discretion and risk. Binance shall not be liable for any loss that might arise from your use of Binance Futures. \n 2.2. Binance reserves the right to monitor your accounts’ risk ratio in real time. \n 2.3. Binance reserves the right to take appropriate measures based on, and not limited to, changes in the risk ratio. Risk control measures that may be used include, and are not limited to: \n 3.1 Implementation of “Reduce Only” restrictions  \n Conditions for “Reduce Only” trading restrictions are set by a risk-control schedule. This schedule consists of the trading position size (“Open Positional Notional Value”) of a USDⓈ-M or COIN-M futures contract, the ratio of the position size in relation to the size of the contract, and the gap between the position’s liquidation price and the mark price. \n Risk control measures are triggered when the gap between the position’s liquidation price and the mark price exceeds the risk-control schedule.  \n The system will automatically implement the “Reduce Only” risk control measures and you will be notified via email. Once this measure is implemented, you will only be able to reduce the position of the contract. You will not be able to increase your position or open new positions. \n If all of the below conditions are met, the Reduce Only trading restrictions will be applied. For specific parameters, please refer to [Trading Rule] - [Reduce Only Trigger]. Please note that the parameter table will be updated from time to time according to market conditions​​: \n 3.2  “Reduce Only” restrictions on linked accounts \n If you trade through multiple linked accounts (i.e. sub-accounts), and the proportion of the aggregated position per symbol across all sub-accounts to the total open positions of the symbol on Binance is more than 20%, Binance reserves the right to implement the “Reduce Only” restrictions on this symbol on all of your related accounts. Please note that this ratio will be updated from time to time, subject to market conditions. \n Reduce Only Trigger \n 3.3 Lifting of the “Reduce Only” restrictions \n When any of the following two conditions are met, the system will automatically lift the “Reduce Only” trading restrictions on the contract within 10 minutes. \n Please note that the below conditions of lifting “Reduce Only” are for reference only.

        "answer_tittle": "1. Definitions",
        "answer": "To provide users with a better trading environment and prevent malicious trading activities, Binance Futures has established the following quantitative rules. \n Quantitative Rules refer to a set of rules that regulate general trading based on the quantitative indicators listed below:  \n Exempt from Quantitative Rules. \n Please note that the current system is symbol-specific. During each 10-minute cycle, symbols with Order Counts above the Recording Threshold will trigger a second-layer calculation (Ban Threshold calculation) to determine if the symbols should be restricted. Symbols that violate the Ban Threshold will be restricted (please refer to the section on Restrictions). \n Please note that the current system is symbol-specific. During each 10-minute cycle, symbols with Order Counts above the Recording Threshold will trigger a second-layer calculation (Ban Threshold calculation) to determine if the symbols should be restricted. Symbols that violate the Ban Threshold will be restricted (please refer to the section on Restrictions). \n For Regular and VIP 1 to 3 users, we have included “N” as a weight in the Threshold calculation, where “N” represents the number of symbols with Open Orders in each 10-minute cycle. \n Qualified liquidity providers are currently exempted from the restriction. Binance reserves the right to revoke this exemption for any account at its sole discretion. \n LEVEL 1 RESTRICTIONS  - Single Symbol Violation \n Users who violate the Quantitative Rules will not be allowed to open or increase positions on the affected symbol for 5 minutes. The restriction will be lifted automatically after 5 minutes. Please note that these restrictions do not prevent users from placing Reduce-Only orders or from trading other symbols that did not violate the rules. \n LEVEL 2 RESTRICTIONS - Repeated Violations  \n Users who violate the Quantitative Rules 10 times for the same symbol within 24 hours will not be allowed to open or increase positions on that symbol for the next 2 hours. The restrictions will be lifted automatically after 2 hours. Please note that these restrictions do not prevent users from placing Reduce-Only orders or from trading other symbols that did not violate the rules. \n LEVEL 3 RESTRICTIONS - Account Violation  \n Users who have 10 (or more) symbols restricted at the same time will trigger an account-level restriction. Users will not be allowed to open or increase positions on all symbols for the next 2 hours. Users can only place Reduce-Only orders during this period. The restrictions will be lifted automatically after 2 hours.  \n Example 1 - User violates Quantitative Rules for BTC/USDT Perp  \n Users will be restricted from opening or increasing positions on BTC/USDT for 5 minutes. This restriction is only applicable for BTC/USDT and it will be lifted automatically after 5 minutes. Users will still be able to place Reduce-Only orders for BTC/USDT and freely trade other symbols that did not violate the rules. \n Example 2 - Repeated violations (≥ 10 times within 24 hours) for BTC/USDT Perp  \n Users who violate the rules 10 (or more) times for BTC/USDT will be prohibited from opening or increasing positions on BTC/USDT for the next 2 hours. The restrictions will be lifted automatically after 2 hours. The user can still place Reduce-Only orders on BTC/USDT and freely trade other symbols that did not violate the rules. \n Important Note \n 1. What error message will the user receive upon violation of the Quantitative Rules? \n { \n code: -4400, \n msg: Futures Trading Quantitative Rules violated, only reduce Only order is allowed, please try again later. \n } \n 2. How is “N” calculated?  \n “N” represents the number of symbols with open orders (regardless of when the order was placed) in each 10-minute cycle. \n 3. Does an open order count towards the Open Order count if it is filled/canceled within the cycle? \n No, it will not count towards the Open Order count. The definition of an Open Order is essentially any unfilled/partially-filled working order.   \n 4. What type of orders are used to calculate the Recording & Ban Threshold? \n All orders successfully placed within the 10-minute cycle are used to calculate the Recording & Ban Threshold. \n Please note that calculation is done for each symbol. \n 5.  If an order placed in the previous cycle gets filled, will it count towards the current-cycle UFR calculations?  \n Only orders that are placed and executed within the same cycle will count towards current-cycle UFR calculations.  \n *UFR = 1- (Executed quantity of orders placed in the past 10 minutes / Total quantity of all orders placed in the past 10 minutes) \n 6. Are rejected orders and Reduce-Only orders counted towards the calculation? \n Rejected orders do not count towards the calculation but Reduce-Only orders are. \n 7. If a user has open orders for more than 50 symbols, does this mean that the user will always get banned? \n Not necessarily. As long as all the indicators (UFR, GCR, IFER andDR) are within the thresholds, the user can trade freely. \n 8. Does the 10-minute cycle begin once the user places the first order, or is there a fixed time window?  \n Each 10-minute cycle has a fixed time window, i.e., 00:00-00:10, 00:10-00:20, 00:20-00:30, 00:30-40, 00:40-00:50, 00:50-1:00.  \n 9. Will users be banned immediately once they exceed the Ban Threshold?  \n Users who exceed the Ban Threshold will be banned immediately or close to the end of the 10-minute cycle. The interval between the violation and the ban is not fixed. \n "

        "answer": "The Binance Classic Portfolio Margin Program is a cross-asset margin program that consolidates the margin balance across different trading products with over 200 cryptocurrencies as collateral. Its designed for professional traders, market makers, and institutional clients who are looking to trade actively, cross-hedge, and optimize risk management in an integrated setup. \n Under the Classic Portfolio Margin Program, all of the supported crypto-assets and positions in the Cross Margin, USDⓈ-M Futures, and COIN-M Futures accounts are accounted for as one joint collateral to determine the account’s equity, margin balance, and maintenance margin requirement. Traders can use the consolidated margin balance to open Cross Margin, USDⓈ-M Futures, or COIN-M Futures positions without any symbol limitations. \n In the illustration below, we demonstrate how the Binance Classic Portfolio Margin Program works:   \n The main difference between the Classic Portfolio Margin Program and Multi-Asset Mode is the consolidated margin balance across different trading products.  \n For instance, the Classic Portfolio Margin Program broadens the margin scope to include the balance on the Margin, USDⓈ-M Futures, and COIN-M Futures Wallets as part of one single joint collateral. Meanwhile, Multi-Assets Mode allows users to share their margin across USDT-M and BUSD-M Futures contracts. \n Users can use their collateral from multiple wallets to open positions across different trading products, gaining significant flexibility and reducing capital constraints regarding collateral management. \n The consolidated margin balance supports over 200 crypto-assets, which can be used to trade on the Cross Margin, USDⓈ-M Futures, and COIN-M Futures markets. Essentially, it turns all supported crypto-assets across multiple wallets into effective margin assets. \n The Binance Classic Portfolio Margin adopts a consolidated portfolio-based margin calculation process. It relies on a real-time maintenance margin check across all positions, which skips the initial margin check requirement and reduces the need for actively placing margin check orders. \n Read the following helpful articles for more information about the Binance Classic Portfolio Margin Program: \n "

        "answer": "Under the Binance Classic Portfolio Margin Program, the Maintenance Margin amount and ratio are calculated on a unified basis. For this reason, the initial margin requirement no longer applies. \n The Unified Maintenance Margin Ratio of the Binance Classic Portfolio Margin account is defined as uniMMR. \n  \n Unified Account Equity means the the sum of (1) the account balance of your nominated Futures Accounts, (2) unrealized profits (if any) minus any unrealized losses (if any) in respect of each position of your USDⓈ-M Futures and COIN-M Futures, (3) Total Assets Value minus Total Liability and Outstanding Interest of your Margin Account, when converted to US dollars. \n Unified Maintenance Margin Amount means the sum of the total amount of Maintenance Margin or the Margin required to maintain margin levels, which is required to be held across all nominated Futures Accounts and Cross Margin Accounts when converted to US dollars. \n Please note that if the margin call time and liquidation call time are too close, the margin call notification will be automatically canceled by the system, we will only send the liquidation call notification to you.  \n Suppose user A has the following margin assets and loan and the margin leverage used is 3x cross-margin.  \n SpotMM = (Loan*MMR) / (1-MMR), while MMR = marginMM/marginAsset= 1-1/1.1 with 3x leverage. \n Let’s calculate user A’s Equity and MM (Maintenance Margin): \n Meanwhile, user A has the following Futures positions and assets in the USDⓈ-M Futures and COIN-M Futures accounts.  \n Let’s calculate user A’s Equity and MM: \n Let’s combine the above calculation to get the Unified Account Equity and Unified Maintenance Margin Amount: \n Unified Account Equity = (6,186*0.99*1.001) + (0.11*40,000*0.95) + (5*2,100*0.95) = 20,285.26 \n Unified Maintenance Margin Amount = (18.4*1.001) + (0.00525*40,000) + (1.5*2,100) = 3,378.41 \n uniMMR = (20,285.26/3,378.41) * 100% = 600.44% \n  \n "

        "answer_tittle": "When does liquidation occur?",
        "answer": "Liquidation occurs when an account’s Unified Maintenance Margin ratio (uniMMR) falls below 105%. In such cases, the liquidation system will take over the account and the user will not be able to perform any transactions during the liquidation process. \n Once liquidation is triggered, it wont stop until its completed. Transferring assets into the Margin, USDⓈ-M Futures, or Coin-M Futures Wallets after liquidation has begun will not stop nor reverse the process. You can learn how to calculate uniMMR from this article. \n When your margin position is liquidated, the margin liquidation engine will take over the assets on the account and sell them to cover the liabilities.  \n Since there is no margin check at the order level, placing a large order may cause the uniMMR to drop below 105% when the order is executed, increasing the risk of being liquidated. Therefore, you are recommended to perform margin checks before placing an order. You can also set an adequate risk control framework to mitigate liquidation risks.  \n Please refer to the respective articles for more details on Futures and Margin positions liquidation clearance fees. \n All liquidation orders are executed as Immediate or Cancel (IOC) orders during the liquidation process. IOC orders aim to fill as much of the liquidated position as possible. If there are any remaining positions after the partial execution of the order, they will be handled in one of two ways: \n Binance applies liquidation clearance fees for both Margin and Futures positions. Please refer to the respective articles for more details on Futures and Margin positions liquidation clearance fees. \n If your account is bankrupt after liquidation, the liquidation engine will automatically convert your account’s negative assets/liabilities into a USDT Loan in the equivalent USD value (pmLoan).  \n Once liquidation occurs, please check whether your account has any pmLoan. You can repay it through the SAPI API endpoint or the Cross Margin Wallet from the website or the App.  \n Please note:  \n Binance will notify users by email and inmail when their uniMMR falls below the following levels: \n When your account is in reduce-only or liquidation mode, the following order entry error codes will be in effect: \n Futures Fapi/dapi error code: unchanged \n "

        "answer_tittle": "1. Asset transfer logic between different Portfolio Margin wallets",
        "answer": "The Classic Portfolio Margin Account has streamlined the fund transfer features to improve user experience. You can use the new Aggregate balances and Auto-repay to better manage your funds.  \n Transferring funds between different wallets is an essential aspect of managing your Classic Portfolio Margin Account. The Classic Portfolio Margin Account supports transfers between the Margin-PM and Futures-PM Wallets, as well as between the PM wallets and other Binance wallets. Please note that certain restrictions apply. \n Portfolio Margin wallets transfer rules: \n Using the Transfer BNB function, you can transfer BNB from your Margin-PM Wallet to your USDⓈ-M Futures-PM Wallet to enjoy BNB trading fee discounts on Futures trading.Please note that you can only use this function ten times per a rolling 10-minute period. \n The Aggregate balances function simplifies the fund transfer process between different wallets and reduces potential errors associated with manual transfers.  \n When you click the [Aggregate balances] button or send an API request, the system will automatically transfer all positive balances from your USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets to your Margin-PM Wallet.  \n Please note that your BNB in the USDⓈ-M Futures-PM Wallet won’t be automatically transferred.  \n Note: For API support specifications, please refer to the Fund Auto-collection part of the API documentation on Github. \n Log in to your Binance account and go to [Wallet] - [Futures-PM]. Click [Transfer]. \n Click [Aggregate balances], and all your positive balances will be transferred to your Margin-PM Wallet. \n API details: \n The Auto-repay function can automatically repay your negative balances in the USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets by transferring the corresponding assets from your Margin-PM Wallet, provided that you have the same assets in your Margin-PM Wallet. No auto repayments will occur if you don’t have the required assets in your Margin-PM Wallet. In this case, you need to manually transfer the assets into your Margin-PM Wallet to allow the auto-repay process to operate. \n ScheduleThe Auto-repay function operates once a day, within 2 hours before charging the negative balance interest. The daily interest charge time is 00:00 (UTC). \n For example, if the system auto-repays 50% of your BTC negative balance at 22:50 (UTC) and you transfer more BTC into your Margin-PM Wallet at 23:00 (UTC), the system won’t auto-repay again on the same day (as the function only operates once a day). \n Limitations \n Auto-repayment only happens from the Margin-PM Wallet to the USDⓈ-M or COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets. This means your USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets cannot automatically repay each others negative balances.  \n For example, if you have a positive BTC balance in the COIN-M Futures-PM Wallet and a negative BTC balance in the USDⓈ-M Futures-PM Wallet as a result of trading ETHBTC USDⓈ-M Futures contract, auto-repayment cannot occur. In this case, you must manually transfer BTC from the COIN-M Futures-PM Wallet to the Margin-PM Wallet using the Aggregate Balances function. After that, auto-repayment can occur from the Margin-PM Wallet to the USDⓈ-M Futures-PM Wallet. \n The Auto-repay function offers several advantages, including: \n The Auto-repay function is activated by default. You can choose to deactivate Auto-repay and switch to Manual Repay from the [Futures-PM] interface, as shown below: \n Notes:-If you disable Auto-repay and have a negative asset balance in your USDⓈ-M-PM or COIN-M -PM Wallets, you must manually transfer assets from Margin-PM to either USDⓈ-M-PM or COIN-M-PM Wallets. \n -When Auto-repay is activated, manual repayment of assets from Margin-PM to either USDⓈ-M-PM or COIN-M-PM Wallets is allowed for a specific asset until its negative balance is restored. \n Please note that negative balances in the USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets may incur interest charges. However, there is an interest-free threshold for each asset (refer to the table under point 9 for the threshold per asset) \n Repayment order \n The Auto-repay function will repay the negative balances in your USDⓈ-M or COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets in no particular order. For example, you have negative balances in your USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets after trading BTC-Margin contracts. The Auto-repay function will perform repayments in a random order. \n NegativeBalance for a particular asset occurs when the combined balance of free assets (reflected as “available balance”) in  the Margin-PM, USDⓈ-M Futures-PM, and COIN-M Futures-PM Wallets is negative, indicating a deficit in that specific asset. It is calculated independently with a specific negative balance threshold for each asset.* \n You can have a negative balance on your USDⓈ-M and Coin-M Futures-PM Wallets, as long as your uniMMR remains above the liquidation threshold (105%).  \n If your negative balances exceed the threshold, you’ll be charged an interest fee once a day at 00:00 (UTC). This interest fee is calculated based on your Margin Loans daily interest rate and the negative balances absolute value. Please note that if you have the required assets in your wallet, the system will automatically attempt to repay your negative balances within two hours before the interest charge. \n Please note that Auto-exchange does not apply to the Classic Portfolio Margin Account. \n To calculate the interest fee: \n interestFee = abs(negativeBalance) * dailyInterestRate \n negativeBalance = min(totalAssetBalanceAcrossPMWallets + negative_threshold,0) \n Where: \n For example, if your negative balance is -10,050 USDT and the daily interest rate for your Margin Loan is 0.1%, the interest fee would be: \n interestFee = abs(-50) * 0.001 = 0.05 USDT \n *For instance, if your BTC balance is negative in the USDⓈ-M Futures-PM Wallet, but is counterbalanced by a positive BTC balance in the COIN-M Futures-PM or Margin-PM Wallets. It will result in a net positive overall BTC balance in the Portfolio Margin supported wallets. NegativeBalance for BTC will not apply and, consequently, no interest will be charged. \n Please note that Classic Portfolio Margin users can query the current interest rate (daily and yearly) and their negative balance interest history via the following API endpoint: \n You can refer to Binance Portfolio Margin API for more details. \n Users can transfer assets between cross margin accounts of sub-accounts within the same main account.  \n You can refer to Binance Link API Docs for more details. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "How to access the Binance Volatility Index? ",
        "answer": "Binance Volatility Index (BVOL) is a derivative financial tool to measure the implied volatility of the cryptocurrency market. \n The Volatility Index is derived from the Binance Options market’s crypto trades, such as BTC and ETH. It is calculated using a formula that factors in the weighted average of the implied volatility of specific crypto options contracts. \n The Volatility Index, or BVOL, is a useful tool for traders and investors as it provides a real-time measure of the markets expectation of future volatility. This Index can be used to gauge market sentiment, improve risk management, and help traders make more informed decisions. A high BVOL indicates that significant price changes are anticipated, while a low BVOL suggests minor price fluctuations are expected. \n 1. Go to [Derivatives] - [Options]. \n 2. You’ll then see the Binance Volatility Index on the Option’s trading page under the relevant contracts.  \n 3. You can also find the Binance Volatility Index here. Alternatively, you can click the [BVOL Index] tab under the [Tools] section to access the Volatility Index page from the Option’s trading page. \n  \n   \n Binance Volatility Index CalculationThe Binance Volatility Index measures the expected level of volatility in the crypto market. This Index is a weighted average of the implied volatility of options contracts with different strike prices and expiration dates. \n To estimate the expected volatility, the Volatility Index uses a mathematical model that takes into account the prices of put and call options. This calculation is based on a 30-day period and results in a percentage value that represents the markets expectation of the magnitude of future price changes in the reference crypto. \n The formula for calculating the Binance Volatility Index is as follows: \n Where the components of the formula are described as follows: \n The Options implied variances are calculated through the following formula: \n Where the components of the formula are described as follows: \n Note: Part of the formula is a sum that runs through the specific term strikes, thus the presence of the “i” tag in the formula. \n The Volatility Index estimates the volatility of the underlying asset by looking at the perceived volatility at a future point in time (30 days from now). \n The way this is computed is by looking at: \n By looking at these options and “averaging” them, a proxy of the perceived volatility can be obtained in a time range between the 2 expiration, namely 30 days from the observation time. \n To enhance the accuracy of the derived measure, the following steps are taken to select the options and strikes used in the Index calculation: \n This detail is important as it’s the reason why the number of options used in the calculation of the Volatility Index changes through time. The strike price range of options with non-zero bids tends to expand and contract, causing this variability. \n Once two consecutive call/put options have zero bid prices, no options with higher/lower strikes will be considered. \n See the example below, assuming the at-the-money strike price is 20,000 USDT. It’s also important to note that the quoted values are an example only. \n  \n Put Options: \n Call Options: \n  \n Note: The only case for which both a call and a put option are selected for the same strike is for the at-the-money strike option. \n The standard expiration selection logic aligns with the original Volatility Index expiration selection method, which restricts the option selection range from 23 to 37 days prior to expiration. \n Should the quotes for these option expirations are insufficient to accurately calculate the Volatility Index value, the selection boundaries will be broadened. This adjustment allows for more flexibility by incorporating dates that fall before the 23-day threshold and beyond the 37-day limit. Please note that this is a rare case, but the flexibility is critical to ensure the continuous calculation of the Index. \n To improve the quality of the Binance Volatility Index and its utility as a reference point, a smoothing mechanism known as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is applied. Currently, a 240-point EMA is in effect. This means for each computation performed every second, data from a preceding 240-second window is taken into account. \n  \n Formula:  \n Where the following holds for the half-life decay factor Lambda: \n  \n a Lambda of roughly 0.01 is associated to a window of 120 seconds \n This method improves the index stability and the safety of its use as a reference value. \n "

        "answer": "In options trading, max pain is the strike price at which the underlying asset price would cause most financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration. \n The Maximum Pain theory states that an options price will gravitate towards a max pain price that causes the maximum number of options to expire worthless. In some cases, the max pain price equals the option strike price.  \n You can calculate the max pain price by scanning all Calls and Puts and cross-referencing them against each possible strike price at expiration.  \n First, calculate the cumulative intrinsic value for both call and put contracts when the index price is at each strike price at expiration, where the intrinsic value measures the worth of the Call or Put Options as below: \n Call Intrinsic Value = (Index Price - Strike Price) * Open Interest \n Put Intrinsic Value = (Strike Price - Index Price) * Open Interest \n As the asset index price at expiration drops, the cumulative intrinsic value of in-the-money Puts at each strike would increase. At the same time, as the asset index price at expiration goes higher, it would increase the cumulative intrinsic value of in-the-money Calls at each strike. \n The max pain will be where the sum of intrinsic value for Puts and Calls is the smallest. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and go to [Information] - [Options Data]. \n Alternatively, you can visit the Options Data page. \n 2.

New net asset value (NAV) = NAV × (1 - Funding rate). \n Example: If the funding rate for BTCDOWN is - 0.0304%, then net asset value (NAV) will increase 0.0304% when the funding rate is collected. \n 8.1. Binance leveraged token positions are only rebalanced when necessary, which is controlled by Binances proprietary algorithm. The goal is to maximize the correlation between Binance leveraged tokens and the underlying margin positions without having to worry about liquidity. \n 8.2. The target leverage range for Binance leveraged tokens is maintained between 1.25x and 4x. The actual target leverage multiplier is not made public and changes constantly. This way, the outside world is unable to predict the target leverage multiplier maintained for Binance leveraged tokens or when rebalancing will occur, thereby reducing pre-trading and manipulation. \n Net asset value (NAV) = ((1 / Actual leverage multiplier) × Basket position × Price of underlying asset) / Issued tokens. \n 10.1. Binance provides information distribution, supervision, and risk control services for leveraged token trading. Binance does not provide any guarantee of returns or obligation of capital preservation for users who carry out leveraged token transactions on the Binance platform. Investors should be fully aware of the greater risks associated with leveraged token services. Additionally, they should self-assess possible losses and voluntarily participate based on confirming that the risks are controllable and bearable. \n 10.2. The terms exceed and less than as mentioned in these rules do not include numbers, whereas not exceeding, no less than, above, and up to include numbers. \n 10.3. These rules are formulated by the Binance platform and will be effective immediately upon dissemination to all platform investors. The same applies to amendments. \n 10.4. Binance platform holds the right to the interpretation of these rules. \n  \n *Disclaimer: The numbers in this article are subject to change without further notice.

        "answer": "Please read this risk disclosure statement carefully.  \n Binance describes the general and specific risks associated with Leveraged Tokens (“Leveraged Tokens”) as part of Binance’s products and services you may enter into from time to time. This statement is not meant to be an exhaustive list.  \n You must read this statement in accordance with Binance Terms of Use found at https://www.binance.com/en/terms. Binance offers Leveraged Tokens as products and services to you on the basis that you understand the risks involved. \n You should always carefully consider whether Binance Leveraged Tokens are consistent with your risk tolerance, investment objectives, investment experience or sophistication, financial condition, financial needs and personal circumstances and other considerations that may be relevant to you. \n You should keep yourself informed and be aware of investment risks generally, and in particular, the following: \n Investing/trading in Leveraged Tokens is a risky endeavour. Although Binance Leveraged Tokens generally have lower risks and costs compared to derivatives and conventional leveraged tokens (managed by other than Binance), they are not a risk-free investment.  \n As a trader, you must acknowledge and agree that you shall access and use Binance Leveraged Tokens at your own risk. You should fully understand the risks associated with Binance Leveraged Tokens and be solely responsible and liable for any and all trading and non-trading activity on your Binance account.  \n Do not enter into a transaction or invest using funds that are beyond your financial means. \n Investors or traders with longer-term investment horizons shall purchase and hold the Binance Leveraged Tokens at their own risk. There is a possibility that the value of Binance Leveraged Tokens can become zero (0) and cannot be recovered due to inherent market risks, high fees, slippage, rebalance algorithm frontrunning and any other perceived unknown risks associated with Binance Leveraged Tokens. \n Binance Leveraged Tokens are designed to be unpredictable in rebalance to reduce the vulnerability of being attacked by algorithms on the market. Unlike conventional leveraged tokens (not managed by Binance), Binance Leveraged Tokens do not maintain a constant leverage ratio. Hence, Binance Leveraged Tokens only rebalance during extreme market movements.  \n The rebalancing of positions of Binance Leveraged Tokens is governed by Binance’s proprietary algorithms with the aim to maximize correlation between Binance Leveraged Tokens and the underlying margin-leverage position without a profit-guarantee. \n Before you invest or trade Binance Leveraged Tokens, you should obtain a clear explanation of all commissions, fees and other charges for which you will be liable.  \n These fees will affect your expected returns: \n i. Trading Fees: Trading fees are charged when buying or selling tokens in the spot market, and the fee schedule is identical to spot trading as further described in Section 7 (c) of Binance Terms of Use; \n ii. Redemption Fees: Redemption fees are charged when users choose to redeem tokens, which is currently set at 0.1% per redemption; \n iii. Management Fees: A daily management fee of 0.01% will be charged at 00:00 UTC and reflected directly in the net asset value of the Leveraged Tokens; \n iv. Funding Fees: Funding fees are paid (or paid to) the underlying fund based on the funding rate and reflected directly in the net asset value of the Leveraged Tokens. Binance takes no fees for funding rate transfers; these are directly between traders. \n Binance reserves the right to modify or change the fees mentioned above at any time and at its sole discretion. Any such updated fees will apply prospectively to any trades or other transactions that take place following the effective date of such updated fees. You authorize Binance to remove any amounts from your account for any applicable fees owed by you under these Terms. \n Due to the nature of Binance Leveraged Tokens’ centralized creation and market liquidity, Binance strives to provide adequate market liquidity and to make Binance Leveraged Tokens available at a fair price. Binance shall take reasonable steps, including, but not limited to, capital injection, additional tokens creation and selling tokens in the secondary market, token split or reverse token split to minimize the risks mentioned above.  \n Users may redeem leveraged tokens at any time except during rebalancing. However, this will generally be more expensive than selling them on the spot market and is not recommended during normal trading times.  \n Binance reserves the right to temporarily suspend the subscription and redemption of leveraged tokens, but users can still trade in the secondary market.  \n Please refer to Binance Leveraged Tokens Trading Rules for the limit of subscription and redemption. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is a reverse token split?",
        "answer": "In order to provide a better trading experience for Binance users, some Leveraged Tokens will undergo a reverse token split process under certain circumstances. Binance will announce the arrangements for reverse token splits prior to the effective time. \n A reverse token split is a process that consolidates the existing number of issued tokens into a smaller number of proportionally more valuable tokens. When extreme market fluctuations decrease the value of a token, a reverse token split often happens so as to boost the token’s liquidity and price. Reverse splits are not an entirely new financial concept, it sometimes occurs in traditional securities too, such as stocks. \n For example, Binance announced that YFIDOWN will undergo a 10,000-for-1 reverse token split on 1 May, this means that every 10,000 YFIDOWN tokens will be consolidated into 1 YFIDOWN token after 1 May.  \n If users hold YFIDOWN tokens after the reverse token split, Binance will consolidate these tokens at a ratio of 10,000 YFIDOWN (before the reverse split) = 1 YFIDOWN (after the reverse split). The YFIDOWN token balance will be updated after the process is complete. Due to unit limitations, the new YFIDOWN balance can only be updated up to 8 decimal places. \n Based on the reverse split ratio of 10,000:1, if the total number of issued YFIDOWN tokens before the reverse token split is 100 billion, the total number of issued YFIDOWN tokens after the process will be 10 million. Therefore, if a user holds 1,000,000 YFIDOWN tokens before the 10,000-for-1 reverse token split, he will end up holding 100 YFIDOWN tokens afterward. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "Binance Leveraged Tokens FAQ",
        "answer": " \n 1. Are leveraged tokens cryptocurrencies? \n Leveraged tokens are not cryptocurrencies. Leveraged tokens are a type of financial derivative that is similar in nature to a traditional leveraged ETF. Like traditional leveraged ETFs, leveraged token investments have zero duration, as well as continuous new price quotes. The net value of a leveraged token moves along with that of the underlying asset. Since leveraged tokens tend to be highly pegged to the underlying asset, they trend extremely close to one another. Therefore, the price of the leveraged token moves up or down the same amount as the price of the underlying asset. \n Leveraged tokens are not like mutual funds, as the net value of the fund is calculated by adding up the prices of all stocks, bonds, and other assets the fund has invested in when the market closes at the end of the day. This is usually calculated using the closing price, so there is only one net value price each day. \n Leveraged tokens are limited to the same trading methods as other tokens and can be bought or sold on the spot market. So keep in mind that since leveraged tokens arent hosted on-chain and dont have a limited supply, they arent cryptocurrencies. \n  \n 2. Do leveraged tokens have a set limited supply? How does Binance ensure that the net value of a leverage token isnt distorted when the supply is increased? \n As mentioned above, leveraged tokens are similar in nature to traditional leveraged ETFs. Traditional leveraged ETFs are open-ended funds, so users can buy or sell them on the secondary market, as well as subscribe or redeem whenever they want. Since users are able to subscribe to or redeem leveraged tokens, there isnt a fixed supply. As the issuer of Binance Leveraged Tokens, Binance is able to increase the leveraged token supply based on market liquidity and user demand. \n Whenever Binance creates additional leveraged tokens, additional Binance perpetual contract positions are added to the basket of each leveraged token. Information regarding the addition of Binance perpetual contract positions and the creation of additional tokens is public and transparent. How can Binance prove that the net value of leveraged tokens wont be affected by the creation of additional tokens? The net value formula is shown below. If Binance created additional leveraged tokens without adding perpetual contract positions to the basket of each leveraged token, the net value would gradually decrease. However, since Binance adds additional perpetual contract positions to the basket of each leveraged token whenever additional tokens are created, the net value of the leveraged tokens wont be distorted. \n Net Value = ((1 / Real leverage) × Basket × Price of the underlying asset) / Issued token supply \n Binance makes public the creation of additional leveraged tokens and the increase in perpetual contract positions in the basket of each leveraged token. Users can get this information on the Binance Leveraged Tokens web page and in the Position Adjustment History. \n  \n 3. Why isnt the performance of leveraged tokens synced with that of the underlying asset? For example, lets say that BTC has had a volatility rate of -10% over the past 24 hours. The net value of the BTCDOWN leveraged token has not increased, but what if it dropped 50% over the past 24 hours? (Suppose the leverage multiplier for BTCDOWN is 3x). \n We cant only take into account the change in price (ending - beginning) of a financial product to figure out its rate of return. The price of a leveraged token always follows price movements in the perpetual contracts market, which causes the margin level to fluctuate. Therefore, the net value of a leveraged token is subject to changes in the underlying asset, i.e. changes in the price of the perpetual contract every millisecond and continuous compound interest. The formula is: P(n) = P(0) × (1 + Delta)!, wherein P(n) is the latest price, P(0) is the beginning price, and Delta is the percentage change of the asset in a given period of time. \n For example, at T0, the price of underlying asset X is 10 USDT, and we assume that the XUP leveraged token has a 3x leverage multiplier, while XDOWN is 3x short X asset. The initial price of both XUP and XDOWN leveraged tokens is 10 USDT. \n Suppose that the price of X asset fluctuates within a 5-second window. How will the XUP and XDOWN leveraged tokens perform in that short period of time? \n Price of X Underlying Asset \n (USDT) \n X Underlying Asset \n Volatility \n XUP Leveraged Token \n Volatility \n Price of XUP Leveraged Token \n (USDT) \n XDOWN Leveraged Token \n Volatility \n Price of XDOWN Leveraged Token \n (USDT) \n If we subtract the beginning rate of volatility from the ending rate of volatility (T5 - T0), we get a rate of 0% for X underlying asset, but rates of -20.8% for XUP and -52.2% for XDOWN. So, if we only use the difference between the beginning and ending values to determine the rate of volatility of a leveraged token, it wont be correct, as it doesnt take into account real-time changes in the price of the underlying asset and the effects of continuous compound interest. \n  \n 4. Why has the price of X underlying asset already returned to where it started, but the prices of XUP and XDOWN hardly ever return to the original price? \n Lets use a super-simplified non-leveraged investment portfolio as an example. If the price of an asset goes down 10% one day and then up 10% the next day, you still wont break even. If the value of a $100 investment goes down 10%, it will be worth $90; if its value goes up 10% the next day, it will only increase by 10% of $90, so the final price will only be $99. This probably isnt what you expected to happen. \n Why isnt a 10% gain the break-even point for a 10% loss? Actually, based on the laws of mathematics, we should start with how much you have now and calculate the rate of return youll need from there. \n Suppose your investment portfolio is currently worth $100. If you lose 10%, your portfolio will be worth $90. If you want to make back the $10 that you lost, youll have to earn 11.1% (10 / 90 × 100%) in order to bring the value of your portfolio back up to its original value of $100. \n Therefore, if your investment portfolio takes a loss, youll need to earn a greater percent profit than what you lost in order to reach the break-even point for your balance/PnL. The following chart shows the rate of return required to reach the break-even point for different amounts of loss. \n  \n As you can see, the greater the loss, the higher the rate of return required to reach the break-even point. In terms of leveraged tokens, this kind of corrosion happens frequently. Not only that, but if a particular fund uses leverage, this type of corrosion will be multiplied. \n "

How are profits calculated if I manually cancel or close the grid trading strategy? \n All profits will be settled immediately at market price when you manually cancel or close the grid strategy. \n 5. Why can’t I place a dual crypto grid strategy? \n You may see the following error message when placing a dual crypto grid strategy.  \n This error occurs when the second-highest grid price is below the trading pair’s current market price. To successfully place a dual crypto spot grid strategy, please adjust the upper price away from the current market price. \n For example, in a BNBUSDT spot grid arithmetic strategy: \n The second-highest grid price (500 USDT) is below the current market price (520 USDT). In this case, you won’t be able to place a dual crypto grid strategy. \n However, if you increase your upper limit to 700 USDT, the strategy’s grid price points would become 700, 580, 460, 340, 220, and 100 USDT. The second-highest grid price (580 USDT) will now be higher than the current market price (520 USDT), and you’ll then be able to place a dual crypto investment strategy. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is the Trailing Up function?",
        "answer": "The Trailing Up function enables your Spot Grid to move the trading range upwards to align with an upward trend market. It aims to address the limitations of traditional grid trading where profits are often limited due to price breakthroughs.  \n After enabling Trailing Up, your grid order’s upper and lower limits will automatically adjust as the assets price increases. It potentially allows you to secure higher profits by taking advantage of price increases beyond the highest range of the grid. \n Let’s use the following parameters to illustrate how the Trailing Up function works. \n Parameters \n Grid trading without Trailing Up: \n First, the bot will set up a grid trading structure with a buy order at the lower limit price ($25,000) and multiple sell orders from $33,000 to $45,000 spread equally across the grid based on the price gap. \n If the price rises above the upper limit price ($45,000), the bot won’t place any new orders. It will wait for the price to drop and fulfill the existing buy orders to pair with the sell orders. \n Grid trading using Trailing Up: \n The Trailing Up function adjusts the trading range in response to significant price increases. If the price increases above the upper limit price and the price difference between the grid levels ($45,000 + $4,000 = $49,000), the bot will adjust the grid upwards.It will cancel the lowest buy order and place a new buy order at the previous upper limit price ($45,000). If the price keeps going above the new upper limit price and the price difference ($49,000 + $4,000 = $53,000), the bot will repeat this process and adjust the grid upwards. \n In a Trailing Up grid trading strategy, each grid holds the same quote value, not base quantity, due to the fluctuating price range. While in traditional grid trading, each grid usually has the same amount of the base currency (BTC in a BTC/USDT trading pair) regardless of the grid’s price level. For example, you might buy or sell 0.01 BTC at each grid level, it doesn’t matter whether the price is $30,000 or $35,000. \n 1. Grid quantity in quote \n grid_qty in quote = (initial_value (1 - buffer1) - max(1.5 * buffer2 * min_notional, 1.5 * min_qty * last_price, 3 * tmp_trading_fee)) / (grid_count + 1) \n Where: \n 2. Example \n Due to the precision of quantity, the value per grid is not exactly the same. For example, assume that each grid should hold a value of $300. If the price of BTC is $37,000, you would buy/sell 0.0081 BTC per order, so the value actually is $299.70. However, if the price rises to $41,000, you would adjust the quantity to approximately 0.00731 BTC, and the quote value would be $299.71. \n The price range in a Trailing Up grid is not fixed. As the price of the asset rises, the bot adjusts the price grid upwards, canceling lower buy orders and placing new ones at higher prices. \n 3. Minimum investment \n min_investment = (max((grid_count + 1) * min_notional * notional buffer, (grid_count + 1) * trailing_coef * initial_grid_upper_limit * min_qty)) + max(1.5 * buffer2 * min_notional * notional buffer, 1.5 * min_qty * last price, 3 * tmp_trading_fee) ) / (1 - buffer1) \n Where: \n 4. Trailing cap price \n Trailing cap price refers to the maximum price at which the bot will stop adjusting the price grid upwards. \n First, calculate the estimated maximum price the bot can handle: \n Estimated_trailing_cap= Min(grid value/min_qty, maxPrice) \n Then, calculate the maximum Trailing Up count: \n Max Trailing Up Count = (Estimated_trailing_cap - Initial upper limit)/price difference \n Trailing Cap Price = Initial upper limit + price difference * max trailing up count \n Please note that this price is for reference only. During the trailing process, if you cannot meet the min notional or min qty trading rules, trailing will stop, but the grid will still run in the new price range. \n The Trailing Up function is suitable for rising markets. It enables you to capture opportunities and adapt your trading strategy in changing market conditions. \n For example, when the market exhibits a strong upward trend, you can activate the Trailing Up function to automatically extend your grids upward as price increases. It potentially allows you to capitalize on the upward momentum and optimize your growth potential at each grid level. \n 1. Create a spot grid: Under the [Advanced (Optional)] section, check the box next to [Trailing Up]. You’ll see the estimated Trailing Up price. \n 2. You’ll see [Trailing Up] on the grid order confirmation pop-up and order details page. \n You can monitor your Trailing Up orders from [Running] and [History].  \n 1. [Running] \n You can view real-time data on all your active orders, including Trailing Up orders. You may also adjust your order parameters here. \n 2. [History]  \n You can view a complete record of all your past orders. You may also check the performance of your past Trailing Up orders. \n No, Spot Grid currently only supports single-token Trailing Up. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "What is Spot Grid Trading?",
        "answer": "Spot Grid Trading is a quantitative trading strategy that uses trading bots to automate the buying and selling of assets on the spot market. It places orders in the market at preset intervals within a configured price range. When orders are placed above and below a set price, they create a grid of orders at incrementally increasing and decreasing prices. In this way, it constructs a Trading Grid. \n You can use Binance Spot Grid Trading in volatile markets when prices fluctuate within a specific range. Grid Trading attempts to make profits on small price changes. Through quantitative trading, it can help you trade rationally and avoid FOMO where possible. \n 1. Current Balance \n Current Balance refers to the total balance of the Base and Quote Assets in your running Grid Orders, including Reserved Fees. \n Total Quote Asset Balance = Total Open Buy Order Price*Qty Per Order (represented in the Quote Asset)  \n Total Base Asset Balance = Total Number of Sell Orders*Qty Per Order (represented in the Base Asset) \n In this example, the Last Price is 0.7760 USDT, the Qty Per Order is 14 XRP, and the Total Number of Sell Orders is 26.  \n Therefore, the Total Open Buy Order Price = 0.7696 + 0.7643 + 0.7590 + 0.7537 + 0.7484 = 3.795 USDT.  \n Total Quote Asset Balance = 3.795*14 = 53.13 USDT \n Total Base Asset Balance = 26*14 = 364 XRP \n 2. Unrealized PnL \n Unrealized PnL = Total Open Buy Order Price * Qty Per Order + Total Number of Sell Orders * Qty Per Order * Last Price + Reserved Fees in the Base Assets * Last Price + Reserved Fees in the Quote Assets - Total Investment \n Last Price: \n When the Grid Order is still running, the Last Price is the latest Market Price of the spot trading pair. If the Grid Order has ended, the Last Price is the Market Price at which the Grid Order ends.  \n Using the same example: \n Total Investment: 369.6556 USDT \n Last Price: 0.7760 USDT \n Qty Per Order: 14 XRP \n Reserved Fees: 6.0000 USDT + 15 XRP \n Total Open Buy Order Price = 0.7696 + 0.7643 + 0.7590 + 0.7537 + 0.7484 = 3.795 USDT \n Unrealized PnL = 3.795*14 + 26*14 * 0.7760 + 15 * 0.7760 + 6.0000 - 369.6556 = -16.4216 USDT \n 3. Matched Orders  \n A Matched Order refers to a Buy Order filled at the lower price and a Sell Order filled at the upper price.  \n The number of Matched Orders is used to calculate the Grid Profit.  \n In this example, Area 2 contains 1 Buy Order and 1 Sell Order. This is considered a Matched Order. In Area 1, however, only a Sell Order has been filled. Therefore, this trade isn’t a Matched Order. When the Buy Order is matched with a Sell Order in Area 1, the Buy Order would appear in Area 1 and the number of Matched Orders would increase by 1. \n There are 178 total Matched Orders, which means this Grid Trading strategy has executed at least 178*2 = 356 orders. \n 4. Grid Profit \n Grid Profit is the total profit generated by filled Buy and Sell Order pairs. It is displayed in the Quote Asset.  \n Profit of a Matched Order = Total Filled Sell Order Price - Total Filled Buy Order Price - Sell Order Trading Fees - Buy Order Trading Fees*Last Price \n Last Price: \n When the Grid Order is still running, the Last Price is the spot trading pair’s latest Market Price. If the Grid Order has ended, the Last Price is the price at which the Grid Order ends.  \n Note: If you use BNB to pay for trading fees, the BNB fees will be converted to Quote Assets at the Market Price when your Grid Order is running. If your Grid Order has ended, it will use the BNB price at the time the Grid Order ends to convert.  \n Take the above as an example. The Grid Order has ended, and the Stop Price is 46,617.70 USDT.  \n The profit of this Matched Order = 19.09794350 - 18.97818660 - 0.01336856 - 0.00000029*46,617.70 = 0.09286920 USDT \n The Grid Profit is the sum of each Matched Order’s profit.  \n 5.  Total Profit \n Total Profit = Grid Profit + Unrealized PnL \n 6. Annualized Yield \n Annualized Yield = Total Profit / Total Investment*365 (days)*24 (hours)*60 (minutes) / Order Duration (minutes) \n For example, the Total Profit is 31.30 USDT, the Total Investment is 688.04 USDT, and the Order Duration is 10 days 23 hours 55 minutes. \n The Annualized Yield = 31.30 / 688.04*365*24*60 / (10*24*60 + 23*60 + 55) = 150.99% \n 7. Balance at Stop \n Balance at Stop refers to the Quote and Base Assets in pending Grid Orders when the Grid Order ends. It uses the same calculation as the current balance.  \n 8. PnL Asset \n This means all PnL of your Grid Orders will be converted to the Quote Asset and will be calculated based on the Quote Asset’s value.  \n For example, when you trade BNB/BUSD, your PnL will be shown in BUSD. \n 9. Profit per Grid (Profit/Grid) \n Profit/Grid is the profit percentage after matching the Buy and Sell Orders on each Grid. Depending on the trading mode (Arithmetic or Geometric), you can calculate the Profit/Grid by the Grid’s Upper Limit, the Grid’s Lower Limit, the number of Grids, and the trading fees (c): 0.1%. \n The Profit/Grid for Arithmetic Grids is calculated as a range. The minimum Profit/Grid is generated by the lowest Grid, and the maximum Profit/Grid is generated by the highest Grid. \n Price Difference (d) = (Grid Upper Limit - Grid Lower Limit) / Number of Grids  \n The Maximum Profit/Grid = (1 - c)*d / Grid Lower Limit - 2c \n The Minimum Profit/Grid = (Grid Upper Limit*(1 - c)) / (Grid Lower Limit - d) - 1 - c \n The Profit/Grid for Geometric Grids is a fixed value, since the price ratio of each Grid price is the same.  \n Price Ratio (r) = (Grid Upper Limit / Grid Lower Limit) ^ (1 / Number of Grids） \n The Profit/Grid = (1 - c)*r - 1 - c \n For example, the Grid Upper Limit is 450 and the Lower Limit is 400. The number of Grid is 5, and the trading fee (c) is 0.1%. \n If the Grid is Arithmetic, the Price Difference (d) = (450 - 400) / 5 = 10 \n Maximum Profit/Grid = (1 - 0.1%)*10/400 - 2*0.1% = 2.29% \n Minimum Profit/Grid = (450*(1 - 0.1%)) / (450 - 10) - 1 - 0.1% = 2.07% \n If the Grid is Geometric, then the Profit/Grid = (1-0.1%)*(450 / 400) ^ (1 / 5) - 1- 0.1% = 2.18% \n 10. Qty Per Order \n Qty Per Order refers to the quantity of each order at a different price during Grid Trading. The Qty Per Order is only confirmed after the Grid Order is successfully created. The system will automatically calculate the Base Asset needed to be reserved for the trading fees and the Quote Asset needed to place Buy Orders according to the investment amount entered.   \n After calculating all the assets needed, the maximum quantity that could guarantee the success of each Grid Order is the Qty Per Order. \n "

(the next price is 100 higher than the previous one). \n Geometric: Each grid has an equal price difference ratio. The price range of each cell of the geometric grid is proportional (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8...). The profits are fixed between each grid.The geometric grid divides the price range from the Lower Price to the Upper Price into the number of grids by equal price ratio.

If you choose to invest by BTC+BNB, the strategy will use both BTC and BNB from your Spot Wallet. \n Please note that the actual investment amount required for the Grid Trading strategy depends on the market and may not equal the amount you entered. \n The available assets in your Spot Wallet. \n Your grid creation might fail if there is insufficient balance in your Spot Wallet. Please note that the frozen assets from other open orders cannot be used to place new orders. You can cancel your open orders to utilize your available assets, or adjust the number of grids to reduce the investment amount required to open orders. \n The grid orders will be triggered when the Last Price rises above or falls below the trigger price you entered. \n You can use Stop Trigger to stop trading when the market price triggers the set prices: \n For example, if you create a BTC grid order with no trigger price, a certain percentage of BNB will be immediately bought at the market price for opening the grid trading. If you set a trigger price, the system will wait for the market price to hit the trigger before buying BNB at the set price. \n If you have both BTC and BNB in your Spot Wallet, you can also choose to invest in BTC+BNB to avoid the additional expense (e.g. transaction fees) incurred when buying BNB. \n Once you enable the [Sell All Base Coins on Stop] function, the strategy will automatically sell all base coins at market price when the grid is stopped. When the function is disabled, all base coins will be kept in your Spot Wallet. \n Click [End] to stop grid operation. Running orders will be canceled and all profits will be settled immediately at market price. \n Spot Grid Trading follows the spot market trading rules. You need to abide by the rules when placing orders. \n 1. To check your order progress, go to the [Running] tab and click the order icon next to the order. \n Alternatively, tap [Running] on the Binance App. \n 2. You will be redirected to the order details page. \n You can check the order progress under each tab: \n *To understand more about the Grid Details parameters, please refer here. \n 1. Click on the [History] tab to check your grid trading history and view grid details of completed orders. \n You can use Grid Trading strategy to buy low and sell high. Let’s use BTC/BUSD as an example. Suppose your strategy parameters are set as below: \n The price structure of this strategy will be placed at 60,000 BUSD, 56,000 BUSD, 52,000 BUSD, 48,000 BUSD, 44,000 BUSD, and 40,000 BUSD according to the parameters you set. \n Binance Spot Grid Trading uses normal grids. Orders are placed from the top grid to the bottom grid. When a buy order is filled, a sell order will be placed on the grid above it. As the upper price is set at 60,000 BUSD, the grid strategy will begin by placing a buy order at 56,000 BUSD. This buy order price is higher than the current price (50,000 BUSD), so in theory it will be immediately filled. After the 56,000 order is filled, a new sell order will be placed at 60,000 BUSD. When the buy order at 52,000 BUSD is filled, a sell order of 56,000 BUSD will be placed accordingly and reaches the 48,000 BUSD grid. As the current price is 50,000 BUSD, the buy order at 48,000 cannot be filled, therefore no orders will be placed at 52,000 BUSD. Similarly, the buy orders at 44,000 and 40,000 BUSD will not be filled.  \n This is how Grid Trading calculates the actual amount of base currency needed for placing orders and paying transaction fees. It will then automatically place market orders to buy the base currency needed for the grid. When the grid strategy is successfully activated, the order placement will be as follows:  \n After implementing Grid Trading, when the current price drops to 48,000 BUSD, the buy order will be filled and a sell order will be placed at 52,000 BUSD. When the market price pulls back to 52,000 BUSD, the sell order will be filled and a buy order will be placed at 48,000 BUSD to buy low and sell high.  \n When the BTC price rises above 60,000 BUSD or falls below 40,000 BUSD, the strategy will be suspended. When the price returns to the price range you set, the strategy will resume. \n *Risk Warning: The above parameter settings are for reference only. Crypto trading carries a substantial risk and the possibility of both significant profits and losses. The information here should not be regarded as financial or investment advice from Binance. All trading strategies are used at your discretion and at your own risk. Binance will not be liable to you for any loss that might arise from your use of Grid Trading. We strongly recommend you set stop-trigger orders in advance to prevent uncontrollable market movements from causing irreparable losses. \n Lower Price: Bottom of the grid trading price range. The system will no longer execute orders after the market price is lower than the Lower Price.Upper Price: Top of the grid trading price range. The system will no longer execute orders after the market price is higher than the Upper Price.Grids: Divide the interval upper limit price and interval lower limit price into corresponding shares.Arithmetic/Geometric Mode: The price difference of each grid of Arithmetic is: Spread = (Upper Price - Lower Price) / Number of gridsThe price ratio of each grid of Geometric is: Ratio = (Upper Price / Lower Price) ^ (1/n)*100%; n= the number of grids \n Total Profit: Grid Profit + Unrealized P&LGrid Profit: The realized profit of filled grid orders that are matched by one buy-order and one sell-order. The trading fees incurred during the strategy are already deducted in the Grid Profit. Float Profit: The latest price of the base currency in the current trading pair is the base currencys average buy price. This is the floating profit/loss of the grid trade caused by the rise or fall in the market price of the base currency. \n 1. Why is my Grid Trading strategy terminated/canceled? \n 2. Which wallet balance is utilized for Spot Grid Trading? \n Currently, Spot Grid Trading utilizes assets in your Spot Wallet to make investments. You can check the PnL of your running orders from the Spot Wallet history. \n After Binance migrates grid strategy to the Trading Bots Account, the system will automatically transfer the required funds from your Spot Wallet to the Trading Bots Account when you start a new strategy. Similarly, when you end a Spot Grid bot, the system will automatically transfer the funds back to your Spot Wallet. \n 3. How is profit calculated if I manually cancel or close the Grid Trading strategy? \n All profits will be settled immediately at market price when you manually cancel or close the grid strategy. \n 4. How are the trading fees calculated? \n Spot Grid Trading follows the spot market trading fee rates. Please check the Trading Fee page for more details. \n 5. Why do I need to deposit trading fees in advance? \n When you launch a Spot Grid Trading strategy, you need to deposit a certain amount of the base currency as bid price. It will be used as a reserve for deducting the Grid Trading fees. This amount is not deducted from your Spot Wallet immediately. The system will only deduct trading fees from your balance after the trade is executed. When the grid strategy stops, the remaining reserved fees will remain in your Spot Wallet. When the system detects that the reserve amount falls below half, it will automatically place buy orders for the base currency to refill the reserve. You can check the buy order details under the [Completed] tab on the Grid Trading order details page. \n Important Notes: \n 6. What are base currency and quote currency? \n Base currency and quote currency are the basic units of a trading pair. A quote currency is used to determine the value of the base currency.  \n For example, in the BTC/BUSD trading pair, BTC is the base currency and BUSD is the quote currency.  \n 7. ​​What does the order state represent? \n 8. Why is my Gird Trading order terminated after I canceled all spot trading open orders? \n All Grid Trading orders will be displayed under the [Open Order] tab on the Spot Trading interface. If you cancel an order that belongs to your Grid Trading strategy, the strategy will also be terminated.  \n If you switch to the trading pair that is currently running Grid Trading, you will see a notification on the right of the screen, please check carefully before you cancel open orders. \n 9. Why can’t I place a dual crypto grid strategy? \n You may encounter an error message prompting you to invest in one crypto only.   \n This error occurs when the second-highest-priced grid is below the current market price of the trading pair. Please adjust the upper price further from the current market price in order to place a dual crypto spot grid strategy successfully.  \n Example:BNBBUSD spot grid arithmetic strategy, upper limit: 600 BUSD, lower limit: 100 BUSD, grid quantity: 5.The 5 grid price points would be 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 BUSD.Current market price: 520 BUSD The second-highest grid price (500 BUSD) is below the current market price (520 BUSD). In this scenario you will not be able to place a dual crypto investment strategy.However, if you increase your upper limit to 700 BUSD, this strategy’s grid price points would be 700, 580, 460, 340, 220, 100 BUSD. The second-highest grid price (580 BUSD) will now be higher than the current market price (520 BUSD), you will then be able to place a dual crypto investment strategy. \n 10. Why can’t I sell my base coin? \n ​​When terminating the grid, the system will assess both the market liquidity and the amount of base coin you hold. If you hold an excessively large amount of base coin or the market liquidity is poor, the system will protect your assets and may not sell your base coin. \n If the amount of base coins intended for sale exceeds or equals to N times the maximum market order amount (where N is currently set to 0.9, subject to adjustments based on market liquidity), the system will refrain from selling your base coin at market price and your assets will be returned to your Spot Wallet. \n For more details on the maximum market order amount, please refer to Trading Rules. \n "

        "answer": "Tutorial Video \n Grid trading is a trading bot that automates the buying and selling of Futures contracts. It is designed to place orders in the market at preset intervals within a configured price range. \n Grid trading is when orders are placed above and below a set price, creating a grid of orders at incrementally increasing and decreasing prices. In this way, it constructs a trading grid. For example, a trader could place BTC buy orders at every 1,000 USDT below the market price and place sell orders at every 1,000 USDT above the market price to take advantage of ranging conditions. \n Grid trading performs best in volatile and sideways markets when prices fluctuate in a given range. This technique attempts to make profits on small price changes. The more grids you include, the greater the frequency of trades will be. However, it comes with an expense as the profit you make from each order is lower.  \n Thus, it is a tradeoff between making small profits from many trades, versus a strategy with lower frequency but generates a bigger profit per order. \n Binance Grid Trading now supports USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures. You can customize and set grid parameters to determine the grids upper and lower limits and the number of grids. Once the grid is created, the system automatically buys or sells orders at preset prices.  \n Let’s understand how it works. \n You expect Bitcoin to hover in a price range between 50,000 USDT and 60,000 USDT in the next 24 hours. In this case, you could set up a grid trading system to trade within this predicted range.  \n On the grid trading panel, you could set parameters of the bot, including: \n In this scenario, as the BTC price falls toward 55,000 USDT , the grid trading bot will accumulate buy positions on the way down at a lower-than-market price. As the price recovers, the bot will sell on the way up at a higher-than-market price. This strategy essentially attempts to profit from price reversions. \n For more details, please read What Is Long/Short Grid Trading. \n Grid trading as a strategic trading tool should not be regarded as financial or investment advice from Binance. Grid trading is used at your discretion and at your own risk. Binance will not be liable to you for any loss that might arise from your use of the feature. It is recommended that users should read and fully understand the Grid Trading tutorial and make risk control and trade rationally within their financial ability. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and go to [Derivatives] - [Binance Futures Overview]. Click [Trading Bots] - [Futures Grid]. \n You can also access the Futures Grid Trading interface by clicking [Trading Bots] - [Futures Grid]. \n If you’re using the Binance App, go to [Futures] - [USDⓈ-M Futures] or [COIN-M Futures]. Select a trading pair and tap [Grid] at the bottom left. \n 2. Select a symbol to execute the strategy and set the grid parameters. Select the grid direction (Long, Short, or Neutral), the range, the number of grids, and order size. Then click [Create] to confirm. For example, the screenshot below shows the steps for creating USDⓈ-M Futures Grids.  \n Please note that the following situations may cause grid creation to fail: \n Let’s use the USDⓈ-M Futures BTCUSDT Perpetual contract as an example to understand the process for grid trading. \n Setting a Grid Trigger (optional) \n For parameters #10 & #11: \n You can place your grid limit orders immediately or trigger them when the market price reaches a certain value. The grid orders will be triggered when the market price (Last price or Mark price) rises above or falls below the trigger price you enter. \n Defining the initial structure of grid strategy \n For parameters #1, #2,# 3,# 4, and #6: \n You can determine a series of price levels according to the latest market price (buy, sell, mid-price), and place sell limit orders at a price higher than the market price, and a buy limit order at a price lower than the market price. After that, you can wait for the limit orders to be triggered and executed. \n Initial grid creation process \n For neutral grids, the strategy does not involve an initial position. Instead, the initial position is established only when the market exceeds the closest price point after the initial setup. \n Example: \n Suppose you have set your strategy parameters as such: \n The price distribution will be as follows: 20,000 USDT, 25,000 USDT, 30,000 USDT, 35,000 USDT, 40,000 USDT, 45,000 USDT \n Initial sell orders for the neutral grid will be placed above the current market price. Meanwhile, the buy orders will be populated below the current market price. Note that the price nearest to the market price would be excluded. In this scenario, the initial grid limit orders will be populated as such:  \n Grid Update \n Grid update means that every time a price point is touched, i.e., a limit order is filled, the grid limit order will update in time. The price of the most recently executed order will always be the one that is switched off, meaning it will not trigger any order. Buy or sell limit orders are then filled in again according to the set parameters to maintain the number of limit orders in the grid. \n For example, the initial market price is 10,010 USDT , and the grid limit price at each unit is: \n Assuming that the price drops to 10,000 USDT and the buy order (the initial open position) is executed, the grid limit orders will become: \n Let’s assume the price then rises to 10,100 USDT, triggering the execution of the 10,100 USDT sell order. The grid limit orders will be updated as follows: \n If after that the price drops to 9,900 USDT, the two buy orders (10,000 USDT and 9,900 USDT) are then executed, and the grid limit orders will be subsequently updated as follows: \n And so on. \n 5. Setting a Stop Trigger (optional) \n For parameter #12: \n You can manually terminate grid operation or set Stop Trigger. \n Stop Trigger: When the market price rises above Stop_upper_limit or falls below Stop_lower_limit, i.e., the market is no longer following a swinging trend, the grid will stop its operation. \n 6. Order Cancellation \n For parameters #13 & #14: \n You can choose to cancel all orders and close all positions manually or automatically after the grid has been stopped. \n When the [Cancel all orders on stop] is enabled, the system will automatically cancel all the unfilled orders for the symbol when the grid is stopped. When the close all positions on stop is enabled, the system will automatically close all open positions at market price for the symbol when the grid is stopped. \n Please note that during grid operation, the following scenarios will cause the grid to terminate: \n The system will notify you if a grid is currently in operation. For example, the recommended grid trading leverage is below 20x. If the leverage continues to be higher than 20x, you will see a second reminder to lower the leverage. \n Choose the contract on which the trading bot will be deployed.  \n All grids, whether in USDⓈ-Margined or Coin-Margined, operate in the Cross Margin mode by default. Currently, only the Cross Margin mode is supported for grid trading. \n In the Cross Margin mode, the margin is pooled together and shared among all trading pairs within the user’s Futures account. \n Start by adjusting the leverage. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses. With leverage, you can magnify relatively small price movements to potentially create profits. However, leverage is a double-edged sword, please use it prudently. \n *Cannot be modified after placing the grid order \n Set the lower price and the upper price of the grid. If the highest or the lowest grid is exceeded, no more positions will be opened. For example, if the current BTCUSDT perpetual Futures price is 48,000 USDT and you expect the price will fall when it goes above 49,000 USDT. In this case, you can set the upper price to 49,000 USDT. After the price reaches 49,000 USDT, the grid will no longer open positions. \n *Cannot be modified after placing the grid order \n Arithmetic: Each grid has an equal price difference. \n The arithmetic grid divides the price range from grid_lower_limit to grid_upper_limit into grid_count by an equal price difference. \n The price difference of each grid is: \n price_diff = (grid_upper_limit - grid_lower_limit) / grid_count \n Then it constructed a series of price intervals: \n price_1 = grid_lower_limit \n price_2 = grid_lower_limit + price_diff \n price_3 = grid_lower_limit + price_diff * 2 \n ... \n price_n = grid_lower_limit + price_diff * (n-1) \n At grid_upper_limit, n = grid_count \n Example: Arithmetic price_diff = 100: 1,000, 1,100, 1,200, 1,300, 1,400,... (the next price is 100 higher than the previous one) \n Geometric: Each grid has an equal price difference ratio. \n The geometric grid divides the price range from grid_lower_limit to grid_upper_limit into grid_count by an equal price ratio. \n The price ratio of each grid is: \n price_ratio = (grid_upper_limit / grid_lower_limit) ^ (1/grid_count) \n The price difference of each grid is: \n price_diff_percentage = ( (grid_upper_limit / grid_lower_limit) ^ (1/grid_count) - 1) * 100% \n Then it constructed a series of price intervals: \n price_1 = grid_lower_limit \n price_2 = grid_lower_limit * price_ratio \n price_3 = grid_lower_limit * price_ratio ^ 2 \n ... \n price_n = grid_lower_limit * price_ratio ^ (n-1) \n At grid_upper_limit, n = grid_count \n Example: Geometric grid price_diff_percentage = 10%: 1,000, 1,100, 1,210, 1,331, 1,464.1,... (the next price is 10% higher than the previous one) \n *Cannot be modified after placing the grid order \n Note: Price difference cannot be lower than the tick size, otherwise you need to adjust the Grid_count or Grid upper/lower limit. \n How to calculate? \n 1). Arithmetic grid, price_diff = (grid_upper_limit - grid_lower_limit)/gridCount < tickSize \n 2). Geometric grid, min_price_diff = grid_lower_limit*price_ratio < tickSize , price_ratio = (grid_upper_limit / grid_lower_limit) ^ (1/grid_count) \n If the profit/grid is less than the maker commission, you will be notified that the total grid profit may not be able to cover trading fees. \n How to calculate? (The profit/grid displayed is for reference only) \n 1). Arithmetic grid \n d = (grid_upper_limit - grid_lower_limit) / grid_count \n c = TradingFeeRate (your current maker fee rate) \n profit_per_grid_lower = (grid_upper_limit * (1-c)) / (grid_upper_limit-d) - 1 - c \n profit_per_grid_higher = (1-c) * d / grid_lower_limit-2c \n Example: Price interval = 1,000 - 2,000, Grid_count = 10, Commission = 0.1% \n Price difference of each grid is = (2000-1000) / 10 = 100 \n profit_per_grid_lower = (2000*(1-0.1%)) / (2000-100) - 1 - 0.1% = 5.05% \n profit_per_grid_higher = (1-0.1%) * 100 / 1,000 - 2 * 0.1% = 9.79% \n 2). Geometric grid \n r = (grid_upper_limit/grid_lower_limit) ^ (1/grid_count） \n c =TradingFeeRate (your current maker fee rate) \n profit_per_grid_geo = (1-c) * r - 1 - c \n Example: Price interval = 1,000 - 2,000, Grid_count = 10, Commission = 0.1% \n Price ratio of each grid is = (2,000 / 1,000) ^ (1/10) = 107.18% \n Profit/grid = (1 - 0.1%) * 107.18% - 1 - 0.1% = 6.97% \n *Cannot be modified after placing the grid order \n Initial margin = initial_value / leverage \n You can adjust the percentage of the investable amount up to 100% (Initial margin = percentage * margin balance). Please note that it must be within the interval between the min_initial_margin and the margin balance. \n For USDⓈ-M Futures Grid \n Calculate the min grid qty: \n min grid qty = max(minQty, minNotional/grid_lower_limit) \n min_initial_margin= min grid qty * sum (price)/ (leverage * adjust_coef） \n “assuming price” is defined as per the following formulas:  \n assuming_price (BUY) = price*  \n assuming_price (SELL) = max (mark_price, price) \n *”price” is the price of every order in the grid trading strategy, automatically set by the grid parameters. This definition applies every time “price” is quoted moving forward in the article. \n min_initial_margin = sum (min grid qty * assuming price + leverage * min grid qty * abs {min [0, side * (mark price - price)]}) / (leverage * adjust_coef) \n Note: If you have set a trigger price, the mark price should be replaced by the trigger price. \n For COIN-M Futures Grid  \n min_initial_margin = min grid qty * sum (contract_multiplier / price) / (leverage * adjust_coef) \n Define assuming price:  \n assuming_price (BUY) = price  \n assuming_price (SELL) = max (mark_price, price) \n min_initial_margin = min grid qty * sum (contract_multiplier / (leverage * assuming price ) + contract_multiplier * abs {min [0, side * (1 / Orders Price - 1 / mark price)]}) / adjust_coef \n *”min grid qty” is the minimum trade amount of the symbol. You can find more details on the trading rules page. \n *If you have set a trigger price, the mark price should be replaced by the trigger price. \n *Currently, the adjust_coef has defaulted to 0.8. It will be adjusted according to market conditions. \n *Cannot be modified after placing the grid orderTotal investment = Initial margin * leverage \n For USDⓈ-M Futures Grid \n Direction Neutral: \n grid_qty = adjust_coef * initial_margin * leverage / sum (price) \n Direction Long/Short Grid: \n “assuming price” is defined as per the following formula:  \n assuming_price (BUY) = price \n assuming_price (SELL) = max (mark_price, price) \n grid qty = adjust_coef * initial_margin * Leverage / sum (assuming_price + leverage * abs (min (0, side * (mark_price-price)) ) ) \n *If you have set a trigger price, the mark price should be replaced by the trigger price. \n For COIN-M Futures Grid \n Direction Neutral: \n grid qty = adjust_coef * initial_margin * leverage / sum (1 / price) \n Direction Long/Short Grid: \n “Assuming price” is defined as per the following formula:  \n assuming_price (BUY)  = min(mark price, price) \n assuming_price (SELL) = price \n grid qty = adjust_coef * initial_margin * Leverage / sum(contract_multiplier /assuming_price + leverage *contract_multiplier* abs(min(0, side*(1 / price - 1 / mark price)) ) ) \n *If you have set a trigger price, the mark price should be replaced by the trigger price. \n The margin balance of your USDⓈ-M or COIN-M Futures account. \n *Optional, can be modified before the grid is triggered \n 1). Grid trigger type: When the last price or the market price you choose reaches the trigger price, the grid will start running. \n 2). Stop trigger type: When the last price or the market price reaches the top or bottom stop price, the grid will be stopped. \n *Optional, can be modified after placing the grid order \n Your grid order will be triggered when the last price or the mark price rises above or falls below the trigger price you set. \n *Optional, can be modified after placing the grid order \n 1. Stop_upper_limit price \n The stop_upper_limit price should be higher than the upper price, the last price, and the trigger price. When the latest market price reaches the Stop_upper_limit, the grid will stop working. \n 2. Stop_lower_limit price \n The stop_lower_limitprice should be lower than the lower price, the last price, and the trigger price. When the latest market price reaches the Stop_lower_limit, the grid will stop working. \n *Optional, can be modified after placing the grid order \n You can enable this function to automatically cancel all unfilled orders of the symbol when the grid stops. \n *Optional, can be modified after placing the grid order \n You can enable this function to automatically close all open positions of the symbol at the market price when the grid stops. \n *Please note that the above parameter setting suggestions are for reference only.

This can be particularly useful to avoid liquidations, especially in a volatile market.  \n Adding margin gives your trade more cushion, while removing margin retrieves excess funds from a position. However, adjusting the margin doesnt affect the actual size of the position or the Return On Equity (ROE). \n The maximum removable amount is the profit from the grid or the added margin after the grid is created, meaning the maximum removable amount equals the minimum of the current balance minus the initial margin or the maximum withdrawal amount of the trading bots cross margin balance. \n The maximum amount you can remove is determined by either the profit earned from the grid or any additional margin youve added after the grids creation. In other words, the upper limit for removal is the lesser of the two following values: \n If you’re using the Binance website: \n 1. Go to the trading interface and find your running orders. \n 2. Look for the position you want to adjust. Click the [+] button next to the initial margin.  \n 3. A pop-up box will appear, you can choose to add margin or remove margin. \n 4. Specify the amount of margin you wish to add or remove from the selected grid. \n Note: The interface will provide insights, such as the margin balance change and the margin ratio change, to give you a clear picture of the outcome from your input. Please note that adjusting your margin will not modify your position size or your ROE. \n If you’re using the Binance app Pro version: \n 1. Go to [Trading Bots] - [Futures Grid]. \n 2. Tap [All Orders].  \n 3. Tap [Adjust Margin].  \n Alternatively, you can also go to the [Running Order Detail] page and tap the [+] button next to your margin balance. \n 4.

If the [Close all positions on stop] function is enabled with open positions under the grid, all positions will be closed at market price after the grid stops. The PnL of the closing positions are included in the grid profit. \n 2. Funding fees incurred when the strategy is working are not included in the grid profit. \n Realized profit and loss from grid trading is the cumulative realized profits of all completed orders, minus the trading fees. \n For arithmetic grid, Total Profit = Number of Completed Orders * Profit/Grid - Total Commission \n You can click [End] under [Action] to stop the grid. You can also choose to cancel unfilled orders and close all positions manually or automatically after the grid is stopped. \n When the [Cancel all orders on stop] function is enabled, the system will automatically cancel all unfilled orders of that symbol when the grid is stopped. When the [Close all positions on stop] function is enabled, the system will automatically close all open positions of the symbol at the market price when the grid is stopped. \n You can see all your open orders, including partially filled orders.  \n You can see a summary of all completed orders. Each transaction consists of a pair of corresponding buy and sell orders. Profits are calculated based on each pair of matched buy and sell orders.  \n Please note that the BNB commission fee is converted into margin assets using the real-time exchange rate at the time of the transaction. \n Go to the [History] tab to check your grid order history and view grid details. \n Grids Status \n Canceled: You manually terminated the grid \n Expired: The grid was terminated due to the reasons below: \n 1. What happens when Binance adjusts a symbols max leverage?If Binance adjusts the leverage bracket for a particular symbol, active grid orders using leverage above this new limit will expire whenever a new order is placed. \n For example, if ADAUSDT initially had a maximum allowable leverage of 75x and is subsequently deleverage to 70x, all running grids with leverage settings between 71x and 75x will be terminated as soon as new orders are placed. \n 2. How to prevent my grid from expiring due to leverage changes? \n In rare cases, a trading pair may be delisted. This will cause all corresponding grid orders to expire. Always keep an eye on Binance’s announcements for such occurrences. \n Grids may also expire if there isnt sufficient margin to support them. Make sure to monitor your account balance and top-up your margin as needed. \n If the market moves against your position substantially, the risk of liquidation increases. Using lower leverage or adding more margin can help mitigate this risk. \n "

The feature is designed to help users make profits on small price fluctuations as it performs best in volatile and sideways markets.  \n Traders can customize and set grid parameters on their own to define a range to profit from price volatility.  \n We acknowledge that not so many users know how to set parameters to build their own grid trading strategy. For this reason, we provide recommended parameters to help improve user experience and reduce the learning curve. These include lower price limit, upper price limit, and grid count.  \n With the new auto parameters function, anyone will be able to create a grid trading strategy with just one click. \n 1. Click [Strategy Trading] - [Futures Grid] located at the top-left corner of the Binance Futures trading interface. \n 2. Navigate to the right sidebar of the Futures Grid trading interface. On the [Auto] tab, verify the recommended parameters and set up your [Initial Margin].  \n 3. Once you have decided the amount of margin that you want to allocate to your grid trading strategy, click [Create], and confirm your grid order so the system automatically places buy or sell orders at the preset prices. It is worth noting that the recommended parameters are set in a Neutral direction and in Arithmetic Mode by default.  \n Please be aware that the auto parameters function will not work when there is not enough trading history on a given asset.

In the geometric mode, each grid has an equal price difference ratio. \n You can learn more by visiting What Is Spot Grid Trading and How Does It Work. \n 1. Price DeviationPrice Deviation refers to the price difference percentage that triggers DCA orders. You can set the price difference from 0.1% to 15%. For example, if you set 5%, this means that the bot will set a buy or sell order for every 5% change from the base order in the selected trading pair.  \n 2. Take ProfitTake Profit refers to the target profit percentage based on the average price (before the trading bot ends).  \n 3. Investment Amount Calculation \n Base Order Size + DCA Order Size*(1+ DCA order size multiplier^1 ... DCA order size multiplier^(Max DCA Orders-1))  Note: The amount will be transferred from your Spot Wallet to your Tradings Bots Wallet and solely for this trading bot. \n 3.1 Base Order \n The base order will be filled immediately upon starting Spot DCA if the price trigger is empty. You can customize the investment amount for the base order. For example, if you enter 1,000 USDT as the investment amount, your base order will be at most 1,000 USDT (including the trading fees).  \n 3.2 DCA Order \n DCA orders are the subsequent orders that will be filled when the price reaches the designated price deviation. You can customize the investment amount for your DCA orders. For example, if you enter 1,000 USDT as the investment amount, each subsequent DCA order will be at most 1,000 USDT (including the trading fees). \n 4.

Let’s use BTC/USDT as an example.  \n Buy-side example \n Suppose your trading bot parameters are set as follows: \n Using the above parameters, you need to invest 3,000 USDT (1,000 + 1,000 * 2 = 3,000 USDT). \n You start Spot DCA by buying 1,000 USDT worth of BTC. Suppose BTC is at $30,000, you will get 0.0333 BTC. After that, the BTC price changed by 5% from the base order. The bot will buy more BTC by placing DCA orders up to 2 times based on the Max DCA you set (1,000 USDT per order). The bot will continue to run until it reaches the target take-profit percentage (10%). \n *The bot will continue to run until it reaches the target take-profit percentage (10%). In this example, the bot will end when this round completes.  \n Please note that the above example does not include prevailing trading fees.

For example, you sold 0.03 BTC at $30,000 for 1,000 USDT. With every 5% change in the BTC price from the base order, the bot will continue to sell more BTC for USDT up to 2 times based on the Max DCA you set and/or until it reaches the target take-profit percentage (10%).  \n The bot will continue to run until it reaches the target take-profit percentage (10%).

When you sell the 0.020979 BNB in a take profit order, you could only sell 0.02 BNB as the 0.000979 BNB is too small to be sold (based on the Trading Rules). This remaining 0.000979 BNB will be recorded as floating profit, which may cause your round profit to be negative. \n Please note that in the [Buy Token] mode, the round profit refers to the quote asset; in the [Sell Token] mode, it refers to the base asset. \n Some possible reasons include: \n It would place limit orders.

        "answer": "Tutorial Video \n The Rebalancing Bot will automatically adjust your portfolio position in the token combination of your choice. By buying low and selling high, your strategy can maintain the same ratio of asset values through rebalancing at preset intervals or thresholds. \n The bot’s auto-rebalancing feature can be triggered by coin ratio or time intervals. \n This system will only rebalance when the change of any coin ratio exceeds the set threshold value. You may set the threshold value to 0.5%, 1%, 2%, or 5%.  \n Example: \n With the parameters above, User A holds 400 USDT worth of BTC and 400 USDT worth of BNB in the portfolio when the strategy starts. The system will automatically calculate the ratio of each token in the portfolio.  \n Suppose after some market movements, the BTC and BNB values in the portfolio become 450 USDT and 550 USDT. The total portfolio value will be 1,000 USDT, and the current coin ratio is 45% (BTC) and 55% (BNB). As the ratio difference exceeds the preset level of 1%, auto rebalance will be triggered.  \n The system will rebalance the positions by buying 5% of BTC and selling 5% of BNB: \n After rebalancing, User A now holds 500 USDT worth of BTC and 500 USDT worth of BNB, and the coin ratio is restored to 50%. \n The system will automatically detect whether to rebalance at a fixed interval. You may set the interval to 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, or 28 days. \n Example: \n With the parameters above, User A holds 400 USDT worth of BTC and 400 USDT worth of BNB in the portfolio when the strategy starts. As the rebalancing by time condition is set to 7 days, the system will automatically calculate the ratio of each coin in the portfolio every 7 days.  \n When the current coin ratio exceeds the default level of 0.5%, auto rebalance will be triggered. The rebalancing process is the same as the example above. \n Please note that the above examples are only for reference only. In the actual operation of the bot, differences between the rebalanced ratio and the preset ratio may occur due to the consideration of trading fees and trading rules. \n Binance and the Rebalancing Bot service do not determine the suitability of any portfolio or Rebalancing Bot parameter and make no representation or warranty that the Rebalancing Bot strategy will perform as expected or will be profitable. Binance makes no representation about the accuracy of the allocation of categories to tokens or the representativeness of any category portfolio of the associated sector. \n Any risk associated with a rebalancing bot strategy resides with the user. Binance shall not be responsible for any losses incurred in connection with any rebalancing bot strategy. \n Please read the full disclaimer here. \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and click [Trade] - [Strategy Trading]. \n Click [Rebalancing Bot]. \n If you are using the Binance App, tap [Strategy Trading] - [Rebalancing Bot].  \n 2. You will be redirected to the Rebalancing Bot trading interface. Go to the parameter box on the right. You can use the [AI Rebalance] for preset parameters or set up your own strategy from [Manual]. \n 2.1 If you choose [AI Rebalance], the system will automatically set up the strategy parameters for you. Click [Create]. You may also click [Copy parameters to Manual settings] to customize the parameters.  \n 2.2 If you choose [Manual], click [Add Coins] to select the coins for your strategy. Please select at least 2 coins. You may select up to 10 coins for each strategy. \n Set the rebalancing parameters, including coin allocation, investment amount, and the auto rebalance method. You may also set up a trigger price, a stop-loss price, and a take-profit price under [Advanced (Optional)]. Click [Create]. \n 3. To check your Rebalancing Bot orders and history, go to [Orders] - [Spot Orders] and click [Rebalancing Bot].  \n You may adjust your investment for a running strategy from [Running]. Click the edit icon to edit, or click [End] to terminate the strategy. \n 4. For an overview of your strategies, go to [Wallet] - [Overview] and click [Rebalancing Bot]. \n When you increase the investment amount, auto rebalance will be triggered.  \n Example: \n Suppose the price for BTC and BNB have both increased. In the portfolio, the value of BTC is now worth 450 USDT and the value of BNB is now worth 550 USDT. The total value of the portfolio is now 1,000 USDT. The current ratio of BTC and BNB is 45% and 55%.  \n The user adjusts the investment amount by adding 1,000 USDT. This triggers the system to auto-rebalance BTC and BNB to 50% respectively. The values of BTC and BNB become 1,000 USDT each after the rebalance.  \n Please note: \n Example: \n Using the parameters above, User A holds 20 USDT worth of BTC, 100 USDT worth of ETH, and 280 USDT worth of BNB when the strategy starts.  \n After the strategy had been active for some time, BTC price dropped and the BTC value in the portfolio became 10 USDT. The value of ETH and BNB remain unchanged at 100 USDT and 280 USDT. The total value of the portfolio is now worth 390 USDT.  \n Assuming User A wants to reduce the position by 50 USDT. The system will sell 35 USDT of BNB, 12.5 USDT of ETH, and 2.5 USDT of BTC. However, as the BTC value (2.5 USDT) does not fulfill the minimum trade requirement (10 USDT), the system will only reduce the position by 47.5 USDT (35 USDT worth of BNB + 12.5 USDT worth of ETH).   \n After the portfolio size has been reduced, the portfolio will be: \n Note: There are minimum and maximum addable and removable limits.  \n Rebalancing Bot users can enjoy a 25% discount on standard trading fees whenever they choose to pay the fees with BNB.  \n You will first pay for the standard trading fee from the Rebalancing Bot Wallet and receive the trading fee refunds in your Spot Wallet. To check your BNB fee history, go to [Orders] - [Rebalancing Bot] - [Fees Return History].Please note that you must have a sufficient BNB balance in your Spot Wallet to pay for the trading fees. Otherwise, you will not receive your 25% trading fee rebate. For more details, please refer to How to Use BNB to Pay for Fees and Earn 25% Discount. \n 1. How many coins can I invest in a portfolio?   \n You need to select at least 2 coins. You may select up to 10 coins in one rebalancing strategy. \n 2. How many active rebalancing strategies can I run?  \n You can run up to 20 strategies. This includes both pending-trigger strategies and running strategies. \n 3. What happens when the strategy ends?  \n If you enable [Sell All Coins on Stop], all of your coins will be sold automatically at market price when the strategy ends. If you dont enable this feature, all of your coins will be transferred to your Spot Wallet. \n 4. Which wallet does the Rebalancing Bot use? \n Rebalancing Bot will transfer assets from your Spot Wallet to your Rebalancing Bot Wallet to support the running of the strategy. \n 5. How are the fees calculated?  \n Rebalancing Bot follows the spot trading fee rates. There are no additional fees charged. For BNB fee deduction history, please visit [Fees Return History]. \n 6. Why is my Rebalancing Bot strategy terminated/canceled?  \n Some possible reasons include: \n 7. Which spot order type does the Rebalancing Bot use to buy and sell coins? \n The system will place a spot Limit IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel) order at the current market price. However, when the IOC order fails to execute, a Market order will be placed instead. For more details on how IOC order works, please refer to What Are Maker (Post Only) Order, Time in Force Order, and Iceberg Order. \n 8. Why doesn’t the Rebalancing bot rebalance? \n Please note that all orders need to abide by the Trading Rules.  \n For example, User A has the following portfolio:  \n Currently, User A owns 130 GAL and 500 RDNT and the coin proportions are 50.6% for GAL and 49% for RDNT. To rebalance the order, the bot needs to sell (50.6% - 50% = 0.6%) GAL from the current position and buy (50% - 49% = 1%) RDNT. \n Let’s assume the market price of GAL is 0.953 USDT: \n Suppose the market price of RDNT is 0.2631 USDT.  \n However, both orders cannot meet the minimum order size (10 USDT). The bot cannot rebalance and will show the following error message: “The order value is less than the minimum value, and is unable to rebalance this time. It will continue to try until the order size can satisfy the Trading Rules. To complete the rebalancing, you can increase the investment amount, or choose a higher rebalancing ratio to maintain your target asset allocation. This can ensure that your investment strategy remains on track as market conditions change. \n 9. What are AI Rebalancing Portfolios？ \n Cryptocurrencies in the AI Rebalancing Portfolios are selected based on data from the Heatmap on Binance Spot. The proportion of each asset is calculated based on the market cap of the included cryptocurrencies. \n The annualized return is calculated based on the daily closing price of each crypto in the portfolio, assuming that the portfolio rebalances once a day. The 7-day, 30-day, and 180-day annualized returns are, therefore, calculated based on the closing prices of their respective number of days. \n "

Using Binances in-house algorithmic trading capability, users can disperse large orders into smaller quantities and execute them at regular intervals automatically to minimize price impact.  \n Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) is an algorithmic trade execution strategy. It aims to achieve an average execution price close to the time-weighted average price of a specific period. \n Traders usually deploy TWAP to mitigate the market impact for large orders. TWAP trading algorithms aim to optimize a trade’s average price by slicing order execution over a specific time duration. \n TWAP is favored to provide a better execution price in the following scenarios: \n Here is an example of TWAP algorithm execution patterns: \n TWAP order duration in seconds (300 or 86,400) \n Transaction details won’t be available until all TWAP orders are filled.

For example, the algorithm may fail to complete the order before the specified end time if the market becomes distressed. \n Binance employs multiple risk mitigation strategies, including manual and automated circuit breakers and kill-switch controls. These features can activate in the event of market disruption and/or systems failure, canceling any TWAP order early when they’re not fully filled. \n To check the status of a TWAP order, you can use the query order endpoints (GET /sapi/v1/algo/spot/openOrders or GET /sapi/v1/algo/spot/historicalOrders). \n Please note: \n "

        "answer_tittle": "1. What is Binance Flexible Loan? ",
        "answer": "Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region. Binance Earn product restrictions apply for Binance Flexible Loan since Simple Earn Flexible Product assets are used as collateral for this product. \n Tutorial Video \n Binance Flexible Loan is an isolated, overcollateralized, open-term loan product.  \n Users are able to take up isolated loan positions made up of one collateral-loan pair each, such as, [BUSD collateral + ETH loan] in one position, and [USDT collateral + BTC loan] in another. Each collateral-loan pair position has distinct Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios as well as margin call and liquidation LTV levels.  \n Each loan position must be overcollateralized, meaning the value of collateral pledged by you is more than the value of the digital assets we advance to you. \n Since Binance Flexible Loans are open-term, you can keep your positions open indefinitely as long as this product supports the loaned and collateral digital assets, and the relevant LTVs are not exceeded. \n You may apply through the collateral-loan pair ordering process and decide which cryptocurrencies you’d like to pledge and borrow. You can also specify the respective amounts.  \n Users may only pledge assets as collateral that they’ve deposited to Simple Earn Flexible Offers (Simple Earn Collateral). If the Simple Earn Collateral is insufficient to secure the desired loan amount, you may also choose to use digital assets from your Spot Wallets as additional collateral. If you choose to pledge these digital assets as collateral, you must first agree to subscribe these digital assets to a Simple Earn Flexible offer. \n Digital Assets that you use to subscribe to a Simple Earn Flexible Offer pledged in Binance Flexible Loan will continue to earn Simple Earn Flexible Product Real-Time APR rewards, but not Bonus Tiered APR rewards.  \n These rewards are accumulated directly in their respective collateral-loan pair positions, increasing the amount of collateral (in token amounts) as rewards are accumulated over time.  \n Upon successful order, pledged collateral will be locked in your Earn Wallet to secure any outstanding loan positions, while loaned assets will be distributed to your Spot Wallet.  \n The total amount of Simple Earn Flexible Product assets that are pledged for the Binance Flexible Loan will be reflected in the [Collateral Amount] column in your Earn Wallet.  \n Depending on which cryptocurrency you wish to pledge, a different initial LTV may apply. LTV stands for Loan-to-Value. It represents the ratio between the value of the digital assets loaned to you plus accrued interest, if any, relative to the value of your collateral. These values are based on each cryptocurrency’s Price Index.  \n LTV = Loan Value  / Collateral Value  \n For example, assuming an initial LTV of 65% for USDT: if you have pledged 1,000 USDT, you may borrow up to 650 USDT worth of loanable assets.  \n Yes, for every cryptocurrency, there are different maximum amounts you can pledge or borrow.  \n For example: \n Lets assume youve already pledged 60,000 USDT and borrowed 20 ETH. If the maximum collateral that can be pledged for USDT is 100,000 USDT and the maximum borrowing amount for ETH is 30 ETH, you can only pledge an additional 40,000 USDT and borrow 10 ETH. These amounts are subject to change. \n In a secured loan, the lender (Binance) has the right to obtain ownership of the collateral if the borrower (user) defaults in their obligation. For example, when the current LTV exceeds the liquidation LTV. This might happen when the collateral decreases in value or the value of the borrowed assets increases due to accrued interest over time. \n A partial liquidation occurs when the current LTV for a particular loan position reaches or goes above the liquidation LTV. ~50% of the outstanding loan for that position will be repaid using the equivalent value of collateral pledged for that position.  \n If the LTV remains at or above the liquidation LTV after the initial liquidation, or if the remaining loan has a value of fewer than 200 USD, the full outstanding loan amount will be repaid using the equivalent collateral value. \n A full liquidation occurs once a hard-cap liquidation LTV of 90% is reached for any cryptocurrency, or whenever an outstanding loan has a value of fewer than 200 USD. The entire loan will be repaid using the equivalent value of collateral for that loan position.  \n If liquidation happens, you will be charged a 2% liquidation fee based on your borrowed amount. It will be deducted directly from your collateral in accordance with the asset’s market price. \n A margin call is issued when a particular collateral-loan pair position reaches its margin call LTV. This margin call LTV represents a warning that the loan position is getting close to the liquidation LTV. You can take action by pledging more assets to increase the collateral value or to partially reduce the outstanding loan, thus reducing the LTV. \n For example, in a BNB/BTC collateral-loan pair with a margin call LTV of 75%, the system will remind you to top up the Collateral Asset when the Outstanding Loan + Accumulated Interest/ Collateral Asset ≥ 75%. \n You’ll be notified via in-mail, email, and SMS in the event of a margin call or liquidation. The notifications serve as a risk warning and cannot guarantee timely delivery.  \n By using the service, you agree that under certain circumstances, you may be unable to receive or get delayed SMS or email reminders. The circumstances include but are not limited to personal network congestion, poor network environment, local restrictions, service providers policies, and device malfunctions.  \n Please note that if the margin call time and liquidation call time are too close, the margin call notification will be automatically canceled by the system, and you’ll only receive the liquidation call notification. Binance reserves the right with no obligation to deliver notifications.  \n Binance publishes all relevant interest rates, and the borrowing rates for each cryptocurrency in Binance Flexible Loan are updated every minute.  \n Changes to the interest rate may occur frequently and at any time. It’s important that you carefully monitor the applicable interest rate. You can choose to repay your loan at any time.  \n Please refer to the Loan Data page for more information. \n Upon a successful loan order, interest is accrued every minute based on the total outstanding loan and the prevailing APR for each minute. The interest accrued after each passing minute adds on to the total outstanding loan.  \n In the [Ongoing Orders] tab, click [Repay] or [Adjust LTV] to perform loan repayments or increase/reduce collateral respectively. You may only repay your Flexible Loan using the same cryptocurrency that you borrowed. Repayments using collateral assets are currently not supported. \n Loan repayments will reduce the outstanding loan and accrued interest proportionately. For instance, you can’t choose to repay either accrued interest or outstanding loan only or in unequal proportions. You may also adjust the LTV for each loan position by increasing or reducing collateral.  \n Binance Flexible Loan offers and accepts a wide range of cryptocurrencies as loanable and collateral assets, including USDT, BTC, and ETH.  \n Please note that same-cryptocurrency collateral-loan pairs aren’t supported on Binance Flexible Loan. For example, you can’t pledge BTC and borrow BTC within a single loan position, but you can have multiple loan positions to borrow BTC with non-BTC collateral. \n The available cryptocurrencies for pledging and borrowing are updated from time to time. Please refer to the Loan Data page for more information. \n You may use the loan for any purpose, including trading on the spot market, depositing into Binance Earn products, or even withdrawing them from Binance. The collateral pledged will remain with Binance Flexible Loan as security for the return of the Digital Assets you’ve borrowed. \n Explore Binance Flexible Loan Now \n Disclaimer: \n This document may have been translated and published in different languages.

However, please note that only qualified assets (tokens that can be collateralized) in the Spot Wallets of your collateral accounts can be considered as collateral. Please be advised that while you are free to perform Spot trades with your collateral, converting them into non-collateral assets will increase your Loan-to-Value ratio, which may result in immediate liquidation. For an updated list of the accepted collateral tokens, please contact our VIP manager. \n All functions and privileges are available to Binance VIP users. If you are not a Binance VIP user and are interested in using VIP Loans, please contact our VIP manager with details of your request and your Binance UID. \n Settlement will usually occur immediately after the loan is approved. Loans are settled directly to your designated Binance account’s Spot Wallet.  \n There are no transaction fees for VIP Loans. However, you will be responsible for the loan interest generated and a 2% liquidation fee in case of a liquidation.  \n Interest accrues daily and is calculated daily between 00:00 and 01:00 (UTC). If your loan is overdue, a triple daily interest will be charged. You will be liquidated if you fail to repay the loan after the overdue period. \n The Loan-To-Value ratio helps determine the amount of loans you will receive based on your existing collateralized assets. You may manage your LTV by transferring assets to/from your Spot Wallet. \n VIP Loans offer a greater Loan-To-Value ratio. VIP Loans generally have greater initial, margin call, and liquidation LTVs at 72%/77%/91%, respectively. Please contact our VIP team to learn more. \n You may repay your outstanding interests and principal (partially or in full) using funds from your Fiat and Spot Wallet balance in the same token you borrowed. \n To repay, go to  [More] - [VIP Loan] or [Binance Loans] - [Loan Orders]. Click [Repay] next to the loan order to input your repayment request. \n You may refer to the  Binance API documentation to find the relevant APIs to perform these functions, or more specifically: \n A margin call is issued when a loan position reaches its margin call LTV. This margin call LTV represents a warning that the loan position is getting close to the liquidation LTV. You can pledge more qualified assets to increase the collateral value or repay the outstanding loan partially to lower the LTV. \n A liquidation happens when a loan’s LTV reaches or exceeds the liquidation LTV. By default, Binance will liquidate any outstanding loan using the available collateral assets. However, users registered in the Delayed Liquidation service will be granted an additional liquidation call grace period that lasts for 24 hours. During this time, you may make any necessary adjustments, such as adding collateral or repaying your loan partially to lower your LTV to the Initial LTV level. If the loan LTV exceeds 95%, we will proceed with liquidation immediately. Please contact your VIP manager to learn more about the Delayed Liquidation service.  \n You’ll be notified via in-mail, email, and SMS in the event of a margin call or liquidation. The notifications serve as a risk warning and cannot guarantee timely delivery. \n By using the service, you agree that under certain circumstances, you may be unable to receive or get delayed SMS or email reminders. These circumstances include but are not limited to personal network congestion, poor network environment, local restrictions, service providers policies, and device malfunctions. \n Please note that if the margin and liquidation calls are too close, the system will automatically cancel the margin call notification and you’ll only receive the liquidation notification. Binance reserves the right with no obligation to deliver notifications. \n Only qualified assets in the Spot Wallets of your collateral accounts can be used as collateral. Subject to the following conditions, you may perform certain transfers and transactions:  \n You are also able to remove any collateral account from the loan order group it belongs by reaching out to your VIP manager, subject to the following conditions: \n Haircuts to the value of collateral assets may apply at different tier amounts for each asset. A haircut refers to the percentage difference between an assets market value and the amount that can be used as collateral for a loan. A 75% collateral ratio on a particular asset means that 75% of the market value of that asset is used as collateral, effectively having a 25% haircut. For example:  \n The VIP Loan Collateral Ratio mechanism allows Binance VIP Loan to offer more collateral tokens that are less liquid. Such tokens carry a higher probable cost of liquidation due to the impact of liquidation on market price, especially for larger volumes associated with Binance VIP Loan. Applying Collateral Ratio on collateral assets mitigates this risk by applying haircuts on the market value of collateral assets.  \n The size of the haircut is largely based on the liquidity of the underlying asset. Less liquid assets receive larger haircuts. Binance reserves the right to amend Collateral Ratios applied to collateral assets at any time. Please refer to the VIP Loan page for the latest Collateral Ratios.   \n "

In the event of any inconsistency, misstatements, omissions, or errors appearing in any translated version, the English version shall prevail. \n Binance Crypto Loans offers a wide range of crypto as loanable assets and collateral, including USDT, BTC, and ETH. Check out the Loan Data page for more information. \n Please refer to the Loan Data page for the available loan terms. You can always repay in advance and the interest is calculated based on the hours borrowed. There is no penalty for early repayment. \n Interest is calculated hourly, in which less than one hour is calculated as one hour. The interest rate starts to accrue at the time of borrowing. \n LTV stands for Loan-to-Value. It’s the total value of your loan plus interest, if any, to the value of your collateral. The value is determined by the index price.  \n LTV = Loan Value / Collateral Value \n We give an overdue duration of 72 hours (for loan terms of less than 30 days) or 168 hours (for loan terms of 30 days and above), during which you will be charged 3 times the hourly interest. If you do not repay after the overdue duration, we will liquidate your collateral to repay your loan. \n In a secured loan, the lender has the right to obtain ownership of the collateral if the borrower defaults in their obligation. This can happen if the current Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio exceeds the liquidation LTV. A drop in the value of the collateral or an increase in the value of the borrowed assets due to accrued interest over time can cause this. The liquidation LTV is the ratio at which the lender can initiate a liquidation process. \n When the current LTV ratio for a loan position reaches or exceeds the liquidation LTV, a partial liquidation occurs. In this case, roughly 50% of the outstanding loan amount is repaid using equivalent value of collateral pledged for the position.  \n If the LTV remains at or above the liquidation LTV after the initial liquidation, or if the remaining loan has a value of less than 200 USD, the entire outstanding loan amount will be repaid using the equivalent collateral value. \n A full liquidation occurs once a hard-cap liquidation LTV of 90% is reached for any cryptocurrency or whenever an outstanding loan has a value of less than 200 USD. The entire loan will be repaid using the equivalent value of collateral for that loan position.  \n If liquidation happens, you will be charged a 2% liquidation fee based on your borrowed amount. It will be deducted directly from your collateral in accordance with the asset’s market price. \n A margin call is issued when a specific collateral-loan pair position reaches its margin call LTV. This margin call LTV serves as  a warning that the loan position is nearing the Liquidation LTV. To avoid liquidation, you can pledge additional assets to increase the collateral value or to partially reduce the outstanding loan, thereby reducing the LTV. \n You’ll be notified via in-mail, email, and SMS in the event of a margin call or liquidation. The notifications serve as a risk warning and cannot guarantee timely delivery.  \n By using the service, you agree that under certain circumstances, you may be unable to receive or get delayed SMS or email reminders. The circumstances include but are not limited to personal network congestion, poor network environment, local restrictions, service providers policies, and device malfunctions.  \n If the margin call time and liquidation call time are too close, the margin call notification is automatically canceled by the system, and you’ll only receive the liquidation call notification. Binance reserves the right with no obligation to deliver notifications.  \n You can use the loan for any purpose, including trading on the Spot/Margin/Futures markets, staking, or even withdrawing the funds. \n Yes, no matter which token you borrowed (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum), you can renew a loan order within 24 hours before it expires. Please note that you must pay the interest on the original order first, and each order can only be renewed once.  \n Auto top-up allows you to better manage your loan positions. After enabling auto top-up, the system will automatically use the same asset in your Spot Wallet to top up the collateral of your loan order back to the initial LTV during a margin call. However, please note that you could still get liquidated during extreme market movements even if you’ve enabled auto top-up. \n "

        "answer": "Note: The Binance Card is no longer available. Binance accounts are unaffected and continue to operate as usual. \n The Binance Colombia Card offers cashback for every purchase you make with the card*. The cashback percentage depends on your card level, based on the amount of BNB holdings in your Binance wallets. Cashback is calculated on a daily basis for each settled** purchase from the previous date. Binance will continue to add new benefits and perks to this program. You can click here to find out more about how your BNB holdings are calculated. \n In case of a refund, Binance has the right to deduct the cashback. The deducted BNB amount is calculated as the initial BUSD amount of the cashback on the date of the settlement and converted to the BNB amount on the date of the deduction. In other words, the deducted amount always has the same BUSD value as initially granted but may have a different BNB value due to the different BUSD-to-BNB exchange rates on the date of the settlement and the date of the deduction. \n *Cashback is paid daily in BNB to your Funding Wallet. The Binance Colombia Card cashback program only applies to eligible purchases made with your Binance Colombia Card. The list of qualified merchants and conditions is subject to change at Binance’s sole discretion. \n Binance has the right to the final interpretation of whether the transaction is a subject of the reward (aka the cashback). We recommend you use your Binance Colombia Card directly for payments instead of using external e-wallets. This can increase your chances of getting BNB cashback for your purchases. \n **Settled purchase or transaction means that the funds of this purchase have arrived in the sellers bank account, e.g., your grocery store. The process of settlement is performed by the payment network and may take up to 30 days.  \n The Binance Colombia Card has 7 card levels. Each level has a percentage reward as shown in the table below.  \n You may check your card Level in the [Card] dashboard from the [Card Info] section or the transaction history. \n *BNB monthly average balance means the average holdings of BNB in your Binance wallets for a period of 29 days before yesterday. The amount of the BNB in the column is the minimum amount for being qualified for the respective cashback levels. For example, if your BNB monthly average balance is 5 BNB, which is between 1 BNB (card level 2) and 5 BNB (card level 3), you are qualified for card level 2 and can receive 2% cashback on your purchases. \n You can see the cashback rewards under [Transaction History] along with the original purchases. Cashback is calculated and transferred to your Funding Wallet after the purchase is settled (typically a few days after the purchase). \n Note that the following types of transactions are excluded from the BNB Rewards program calculation: transactions on digital wallets, digital banking services, crypto exchanges, stored value products, and money remittance services. The list of qualified merchants is subject to change at Binance and its partners’ sole discretion. \n Lifetime Cashback Earnings are cashback rewards you receive in your Funding Wallet at the beginning of the cashback program. \n The total maximum monthly amount for cashback rewards is capped for each cashback level individually. \n In case the cashback received for the current month exceeds the threshold for your card level at the moment of the cashback calculation, you will only be rewarded partial cashback within the cap for the card level. Any further purchases you make within the month will not be rewarded any cashback. \n Cashback is calculated from the 1st day of the month at 00:00:00 UTC. The cashback limit will be reset every month, and you will be able to receive cashback rewards again in full according to your card level. \n  \n "

        "answer": "Note: The Binance Card is no longer available. Binance accounts are unaffected and continue to operate as usual. \n The  Binance Argentina Card supports real-time cryptocurrency to fiat currency conversion, enabling you to spend your crypto assets with merchants globally. Funds can be debited from your Spot/Funding Wallet.   \n Your Funding Wallet is your default source of funds for Binance Card Transactions. To allow greater access to your funds and offer a seamless experience when using the Binance Card, your Spot Wallet has been automatically enabled as an additional source of funding for making payments. Find out more about using your Spot Wallet as a backup source of funding here. \n The Binance Argentina Card makes purchases using an aggregated value of your selected cryptocurrencies in your Spot/Funding Wallet, based on the payment priority you set in the Card Dashboard. \n Currently, the Binance Argentina Card supports 14 cryptocurrencies, including BUSD, USDT, USDC, BTC, BNB, ETH, ADA, DOT, SOL, MANA, SXP, DAI, SHIB, and MATIC. \n You can add, remove, or rearrange the order of the spending cryptocurrencies from [Card Dashboard] - [Payment Priority] - [Edit]. The system will follow the payment priority when you purchase with your Binance Argentina Card. Please note that you must have at least 6 cryptocurrencies in your Payment Priority list, and a maximum of 12 cryptocurrencies can be selected.  \n An example of how your selected cryptocurrencies will fund your purchases: \n Your Payment Priority List: BUSD, BNB, ETC, USDT, BTC, ADA \n If the BUSD balance in your Funding Wallet is sufficient, the purchase will be made solely by converting BUSD. If the balance is insufficient, the system will automatically check whether your BUSD and BNB, ETH, USDT, etc. balance can cover the purchase by following the payment priority you set. The same priority will be used for your Spot Wallet if the asset balance in your Funding Wallet is insufficient. \n The transaction should go through if the balance in your Spot/Funding Wallet equals or is greater than the amount the merchant is attempting to charge. Binance will automatically use all available cryptocurrencies in the order you selected or based on the balance left in the Wallets to complete the transaction. \n You can use your Binance Argentina Card anywhere in the world at any Mastercard merchant. \n Please note that when you use your Binance Argentina Card to transact in foreign currencies, these transactions will be subject to taxes (ARS and foreign currency exchange). For more details, please refer to Taxes on International Payments with Binance Argentina Card. \n You can use the Binance Argentina Card to make transactions online by entering your Card details on the payment page when you checkout.  \n If a transaction is declined after the funds were deducted from your Funding Wallet, e.g., due to network issues that are out of Binance’s control, your funds will be returned to your Funding Wallet (in BUSD) within 2 hours. \n Your card is denominated in ARS. If you make a purchase or an ATM withdrawal in any other currency, we will convert the amount of the transaction into ARS using the exchange rate set by Mastercard on the day they process the transaction. Please note that this conversion rate may differ from the conversion rate on the actual date of the transaction. \n As the Binance Argentina Card is issued within the jurisdiction of Argentina and held by Argentine residents, official taxes apply when you make payments to any physical or virtual merchant outside Argentina and those payments are converted into ARS for billing. For more details, please refer to Taxes on International Payments with Binance Argentina Card. \n You cannot top up your Binance Argentina Card from other external platforms. Funds sent directly from third-party platforms will not be credited to your Binance Argentina Card balance and might result in the loss of these funds.  \n "

        "answer": "Note: The Binance Card is no longer available. Binance accounts are unaffected and continue to operate as usual. \n The  Binance Brazil Card supports real-time cryptocurrency to fiat currency conversion, enabling you to spend your crypto assets and BRL with 100 million merchants globally.  \n The Binance Brazil Card uses an aggregate value of your selected cryptocurrencies in your Spot/Funding Wallet to make purchases based on the payment priority you set in the Card Dashboard. \n Currently, the Binance Brazil Card supports BRL and 13 cryptocurrencies, including BUSD, USDT, BTC, BNB, ETH, SANTOS, ADA, DOT, SOL, SHIB, MATIC, XRP, and LINK. \n You can add, remove, or rearrange the order of the spending cryptocurrencies from [Card Dashboard] - [Payment Priority] - [Edit]. The system will follow the payment priority when you purchase with your Binance Brazil Card. Please note that you must have at least 6 cryptocurrencies in your Payment Priority list, and a maximum of 12 cryptocurrencies can be selected.  \n If the BUSD balance in your Funding Wallet is sufficient, the purchase will be made solely by converting BUSD. If the balance is insufficient, the system will automatically check whether your BUSD and USDT balance can cover the purchase following your payment priority. \n The transaction should go through if the aggregated balance in your Spot/Funding Wallet equals or is greater than the amount the merchant is attempting to charge. Binance will automatically use all available cryptocurrencies in the order you selected or based on the balance left in the Wallets to complete the transaction. \n Your Spot Wallet has been automatically enabled as an additional source of funding for making payments. Find out more about using your Spot Wallet as a backup source of funding here. \n You can use your Binance Brazil Card anywhere in the world at any Mastercard merchant. \n You can use the Binance Brazil Card to make online transactions by entering your Card details on the payment page when you checkout.  \n If a transaction is declined after the funds were deducted from your Funding Wallet, e.g., due to network issues that are out of Binance’s control, your funds will be returned to your Funding Wallet (in BRL) within 2 hours. \n Your card is denominated in BRL. If you make a purchase or an ATM withdrawal in any other currency, we will convert the amount of the transaction into BRL using the exchange rate set by Mastercard on the day they process the transaction. Please note that this conversion rate may differ from the conversion rate on the actual date of the transaction. You may check the conversion rate for each transaction in the transaction details. Please note that an IOF tax of up to 5.38% will also be levied on overseas transactions. \n You cannot top up your Binance Brazil Card from other external platforms. Funds sent directly from third-party platforms will not be credited to your Binance Brazil Card balance and might result in the loss of these funds.  \n 1. Open Samsung Wallet on your device and go to [Menu]. Tap [Payment Cards] - [+] on the upper right corner. \n 2. Enter the details of your Binance Card manually, or use your device’s camera to scan your physical card. It will automatically fill your card number and expiration date. Enter the 3-digit security code and your name as shown on the card. \n 3. Tap [Advance] and wait for the Wallet to validate your Binance Card. Read and agree to the T&C. \n 4. Follow the instructions to verify your card. Once complete, you can use your Binance Card via Samsung Wallet. \n 1. Open Samsung Wallet and slide up. Your Binance Card will appear on the screen. \n 2. Unlock Samsung Wallet with your PIN or biometrics to activate the payment mode.  \n 3. Hold your device next to the POS terminal to pay. You might need to enter your card PIN to authorize the payment. \n 4. You’ll see a [V] icon once payment is complete.  \n Note: Please complete payment within 50 seconds. \n Currently, Apple Pay and Google Pay are not supported. However, you can bind your card to the Mercado Pago Wallet, Ame Digital, or 99Pay. \n "

        "answer": "Note: The Binance Card is no longer available. Binance accounts are unaffected and continue to operate as usual. \n The Binance Brazil Card offers cashback for every purchase you make with the card*. The cashback percentage depends on your card level, based on the amount of BNB holdings in your Binance wallets. Cashback is calculated on a daily basis for each settled** purchase from the previous date. Binance will continue to add new benefits and perks to this program. You can click here to learn more about how your BNB holdings are calculated. \n In case of a refund, Binance has the right to claw back the cashback. The deducted BNB amount is calculated as the initial BUSD amount of the cashback on the date of the settlement and converted to the BNB amount on the date of the deduction. In other words, the deducted amount always has the same BUSD value as initially granted, but may have a different BNB value due to the different BUSD-to-BNB exchange rates on the date of the settlement and the date of the deduction. \n *Cashback is paid daily in BNB to your Funding Wallet. The Binance Brazil Card Cashback Program only applies to eligible purchases made with your Binance Brazil Card. The list of qualified merchants and conditions is subject to change at Binance’s sole discretion. \n Binance has the right to the final interpretation of whether the transaction is a subject of the reward (aka the cashback). We recommend you use your Binance Brazil Card directly for payments instead of using external e-wallets. Doing this can increase your chances of getting BNB cashback for your purchases. \n **Settled purchase or transaction means that the funds of this purchase have arrived in the sellers bank account, e.g., your grocery store. The process of settlement is performed by the payment network and may take up to 30 days.  \n The Binance Brazil Card has 7 card levels. Each level has a percentage reward as shown in the table below.  \n You may check your card Level in the [Card] dashboard from the [Card Info] section or the transaction history. \n *BNB monthly average balance means the average holdings of BNB in your Binance wallets for a period of 29 days before yesterday. The amount of the BNB in the column is the minimum amount for being qualified for the respective cashback levels. For example, if your BNB monthly average balance is 5 BNB, which is between 1 BNB (card level 2) and 5 BNB (card level 3), you are qualified for card level 2 and can receive 2% cashback on your purchases. \n You can see the cashback rewards under [Transaction History] along with the original purchases. Cashback is calculated and transferred to your Funding Wallet after the purchase is settled (typically happens a few days after the purchase). \n Please note that the following types of transactions are excluded from the BNB Rewards program calculation: transactions on digital wallets, digital banking services, crypto exchanges, stored value products, and money remittance services. The list of qualified merchants is subject to change at Binance and its partners’ sole discretion. \n Lifetime Cashback Earnings are cashback rewards you receive in your Funding Wallet at the beginning of the cashback program. \n Yes, there is a monthly limit for cashback.  \n In case the cashback received for the current month exceeds the threshold for your card level at the moment of the cashback calculation, you will only be rewarded partial cashback within the cap for the card level. Any further purchases you make within the month will not be rewarded. \n Cashback is calculated from the first day of the month at 00:00:00 UTC. The cashback limit will be reset every month, and you will be able to receive cashback rewards again in full according to your card level. \n "

        "answer": "Note: The Binance Card is no longer available. Binance accounts are unaffected and continue to operate as usual. \n The Binance Card (GCC) supports real-time cryptocurrency to fiat currency conversion, enabling you to spend your crypto assets in over 60 million online and physical stores globally.  \n The Binance Card (GCC) uses an aggregate value of your selected cryptocurrencies in your Spot/Funding Wallet to make purchases based on the payment priority you set in the Card Dashboard. \n Currently, the Binance Card (GCC) supports 11 cryptocurrencies, including BUSD, USDT, USDC, BTC, BNB, ETH, ADA, DOT, SOL, MANA, and SXP. \n You can add, remove, or rearrange the order of the spending cryptocurrencies from [Card Dashboard] - [Payment Priority] - [Edit]. The system will follow the payment priority when you purchase with your Binance Card (GCC). Please note that you must have at least 6 cryptocurrencies in your Payment Priority list. A maximum of 11 cryptocurrencies can be selected.  \n If the BUSD balance in your Funding Wallet is sufficient, the purchase will be made solely by converting your available assets to BUSD. If your wallet balance is insufficient, the system will automatically check whether your BUSD and USDT balances can cover the purchase following the payment priority you set. \n The transaction should go through if the aggregated balance in your Spot/Funding Wallet equals or exceeds the amount the merchant is attempting to charge. Binance will automatically use all available cryptocurrencies in the order you selected or based on the balance left in the Wallets to complete the transaction. \n Your Spot Wallet has been automatically enabled as an additional source of funding for making payments. Find out more about using your Spot Wallet as a backup source of funding here. \n You can use your Binance Card (GCC) anywhere in the world at any Mastercard merchant. \n You can use the Binance Card (GCC) to make transactions online by entering your Card details on the payment page when you checkout. \n Yes, you can make contactless payments with your physical Binance Card (GCC) where the point of sales (POS) terminals support them. To activate contactless payment on your Binance Card (GCC), you must complete the first transaction of your physical Binance Card (GCC) with Chip & PIN. If the Chip & PIN payment on the POS machine fails, please activate your PIN from an ATM.  \n If a transaction is declined after the funds were deducted from your Funding Wallet, e.g., due to network issues that are out of Binance’s control, your funds will be returned to your Funding Wallet (in BUSD) within 2 hours. \n Your card is denominated in USD. If you make a purchase or an ATM withdrawal in any other currency, we will convert the amount of the transaction into USD using the exchange rate set by Mastercard on the day they process the transaction. Please note that this conversion rate may differ from the conversion rate on the actual date of the transaction. You may check the conversion rate for each transaction in the transaction details. \n You cannot top up your Binance Card (GCC) from other external platforms. Funds that are sent directly from third-party platforms will not be credited to your Binance Card (GCC) balance and might result in the loss of these funds.  \n This card is issued by Infinios Financial Services B.S.C.

        "answer": "Note: The Binance Card is no longer available. Binance accounts are unaffected and continue to operate as usual. \n The Binance Card (GCC) offers cashback for every purchase you make with the card*. The cashback percentage depends on your card level, based on the amount of BNB holdings in your Binance wallets. Cashback is calculated on a daily basis for each settled** purchase from the previous date. Binance will continue to add new benefits and perks to this program. Click here to find out more about how your BNB holdings are calculated. \n In case of a refund, Binance has the right to deduct the cashback. The deducted BNB amount is calculated as the initial BUSD amount of the cashback on the date of the settlement and converted to the BNB amount on the date of the deduction. In other words, the deducted amount always has the same BUSD value as initially granted, but may have a different BNB value due to the different BUSD-to-BNB exchange rates on the date of the settlement and the date of the deduction. \n *Cashback is paid daily in BNB to your Funding Wallet. The Binance Card (GCC) cashback program only applies to eligible purchases made with your Binance Card (GCC). The list of qualified merchants and conditions is subject to change at Binance’s sole discretion. \n Binance has the right to the final interpretation of whether the transaction is a subject of the reward (aka the Binance Cashback). We recommend you use your Binance Card (GCC) directly for payments instead of using external e-wallets. Doing so can increase your chances of getting BNB cashback for your purchases. \n **Settled purchase or transaction means that the funds of this purchase have arrived in the bank account of the seller, e.g., your grocery store. The process of settlement is performed by the payment network and may take up to 30 days. \n The Binance Card (GCC) has 7 card levels. Each level offers a different BNB reward percentage:  \n You may check your card level in the Card Dashboard from [Card Info] or [Transaction History]. \n *BNB monthly average balance means the average holdings of BNB in your Binance wallets for a period of 29 days before yesterday. The BNB balance refers to the minimum amount of BNB you need to hold in order to be qualified for the individual cashback level. For example, if your BNB monthly average balance is 5 BNB, which is between 1 BNB (card level 2) and 10 BNB (card level 3), you are qualified for card level 2 and can receive 2% cashback on your purchases. \n You can see the cashback rewards under [Transaction History]. Cashback is calculated and transferred to your Funding Wallet after the purchase is settled (typically happens a few days after the purchase). \n Note that the following types of transactions are excluded from the cashback program calculation: transactions on digital wallets, digital banking services, crypto exchanges, stored value products, and money remittance services. The list of qualified merchants is subject to change at Binance and its partners’ sole discretion. \n Lifetime Cashback Earnings are cashback rewards you receive in your Funding Wallet at the beginning of the cashback program. \n Please refer to the table below for the maximum amount of cashback rewards you can receive each month: \n In case the cashback received for the current month exceeds the threshold for your card level at the moment of the cashback calculation, you will only be rewarded partial cashback within the limit for that card level. Any further purchases you make within the month will not be rewarded any cashback. \n Cashback is calculated from the first day of the month at 00:00:00 UTC. The cashback limit will be reset every month, and you will be able to receive cashback rewards again in full based on your card level. \n This card is issued by Infinios Financial Services B.S.C.

        "answer": "On-chain Transfer, a new feature on Binance Pay, enables direct transfers of cryptocurrencies from your Binance account to your Web3 crypto wallet address. Trust Wallet now supports this feature. \n 1. Log in to your Web3 wallet app (e.g. Trust Wallet). Choose the token you want to deposit and tap [Receive]. \n 2. Click [Deposit from exchange] and choose [Binance]. You will be directed to the Binance App to start the transfer. \n 3. Enter the amount, and confirm the fee and receiving amount.  \n Please note that the auto-populated address and network are directly sent from your crypto wallet. You don’t need to paste the address or choose the network in this step. \n  \n 4. The transfer will be processed within the estimated completion time. You can return to your crypto wallet app by tapping [Done]. Alternatively, you can view the transfer status by selecting [View Details].  \n   \n 5.

The confirmation time varies depending on the blockchain and its current network traffic.  \n Binance Pay supports cross-currency payments. For example, if you want to transfer 10 USDT but you have only 5 USDT or none in your Binance account, Binance Pay will convert other currencies in your account to USDT to complete the transfer.

That means Binance Pay has received your request for an on-chain transfer, and your transaction is being processed. Please keep in mind that blockchain confirmations take time. \n Youll receive an email once the on-chain transfer is completed. If the transfer fails, youll be refunded. You can also check the estimated completion time and the latest transfer status in [Payment History].  \n On-chain transfer supports a wide range of assets available in Binance Pay and your crypto wallet. If a token is not supported, it could be due to unavailability on Binance Pay or your Web3 wallet. Additionally, Binance Pay might support the asset but not the chosen  network. If this occurs, switch to a network supported by Binance Pay in your Web3 wallet app. You can find more information about the assets and networks supported by Binance on the Deposit & Withdrawal list. \n If your payment is unsuccessful, youll see a pop-up window with the following message: withdrawal address whitelist enabled and this address is not on the list.  \n That means you have turned on the withdrawal address whitelist function in Binance, and only whitelisted addresses are available for on-chain transfer or withdrawal.

Your score will increase if:  \n More specific information than the above will not be provided. Please use trial and error to achieve your ideal trading pattern, or discuss optimal behavior with other API users. \n While we do not provide exact details on our WAF rules, if you are receiving an HTTP 403 error, you have broken a rule. Most likely, it will be a result of excessive requests within a duration of 5 minutes. However, if you are sending a request that could be perceived as malicious, it could also result in a ban of a longer duration. \n For the hard-limits, exceeding the total request weight per minute limit (currently 1,200) will result in an IP ban. The order limits (currently it is 50 times/10 seconds and 160,000 times/24 hours) will be dependent on the account. If the order limit has been exceeded, users will also be restricted from creating new orders on the website (or our other applications). \n For Machine Learning limits, restrictions will be applied to accounts. If a user has been restricted by the ML system, they may check the reason and the duration by using the [/sapi/v1/account/status] endpoint (noted in our API Documentation). \n Web Application Firewall limitations will only be applied by IP. Usually, a WAF ban will have a duration of 5 minutes. However, if the server has interpreted a users request as malicious, it may be extended. \n No. You must wait until the ban period is over. \n You have violated the WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules, most likely by violating a rate limit or sending a malicious request (as outlined in the limits section of this document). Typically, these bans last a period of 5 minutes. \n Every 3 minutes, active WebSocket connections will receive a ping. If you do not respond with a properly framed ping, your connection will be terminated. \n For user data streams, if a keep-alive is not received at least once every 60 minutes, the listen key will expire. This is also detailed in our API Documentation. \n Unfortunately, we do not support third-party services or tools. Please reach out to the service and/or developers for further assistance. \n In addition, it is a security risk to enter your Binance API Key(s) and/or Secret Key(s) into any third-party platform. Please use these services at your own discretion. \n Keep in mind that we also avoid providing general programming assistance. \n Unfortunately, we are unable to provide support for issues with your personal implementation. If you are using a third-party wrapper/tool, please contact their support/development team for assistance. \n For security reasons, by design, Secret Keys are only visible at the time the API Key is created. Any time after that point, it will be masked. If you have lost it, or you did not record it, you will need to create a new API Key and utilize the new key with a new Secret Key. \n Unfortunately, this is not currently offered.. It should be possible to work with the limitations provided. \n There are only two likely explanations for an API Key disappearing: \n 1.

        "answer": "Phishing is a type of social engineering attack. Fraudulent actors attempt to obtain sensitive information such as username, password, two-factor authentication (2FA) code, etc., by disguising themselves as a Binance employees in electronic communication. Phishing emails are one of the most common methods scammers use.  \n 1. To quickly identify whether or not the email is from Binance, you can look up the senders email address in Binance Verify. \n 2. If the source is not verified, please assume the email was not sent by Binance and avoid clicking any links in the email. \n Even if the source address is verified, it could still be a spoofed email. Email spoofing applies various techniques to forge the senders address. It attempts to impersonate someone you trust and tricks you into clicking any malicious links or downloading malware to take over your online accounts or steal funds. \n To better protect yourself from spoofed emails, you can set up an anti-phishing code on Binance and always check whether there is an anti-phishing code and if it matches the one you have set up. \n Read more about how to set up an anti-phishing code. \n 3. If the email does not contain an anti-phishing code, please check if the domain in the email belongs to an official Binance source. If you find the email suspicious, or you are still unsure whether it was sent by Binance, please contact Binance Support to verify. \n Here are some examples of phishing emails. \n The email below was created by an attacker in an attempt to gain access to the user’s email account, password, and 2FA backup key. \n Although the email senders display name is Binance, please pay attention to the actual senders email address. The phishing email was sent from <do-not-reply19@www--binance.com>, which uses a lookalike domain – a common tactic for attackers in order to impersonate Binance. \n If you hover over the “Verify Email” button, you can see the fraudulent link / URL, which, in this case, washttps://www--binance.com/binance/login.php?id=xxxx@axxxxl.xxm. After clicking the button, you would then see this fake Binance page: \n Unfortunately, some users do fall victim to such ruses and fill in their Binance email account and password data on the scam website (www--binance.com). After clicking the “Log In” button, users will see a special dialog window, as seen below: \n Unfortunately, some victims disclose their 2FA backup keys without hesitation. When this happens, the hacker would have successfully collected the victim’s username/password/2FA, thus gaining full access to the victim’s accounts. \n Read more about more examples of different phishing sites. \n The phishing email below persuaded users to download a fake PDF file, which was actually malware/virus/Trojan software. Please pay attention to the overall email structure and its poor layout: \n The phishing email below instructed users to click a malicious link in order to receive a nonexistent 0.129 BTC. \n When you notice such a message, it’s always best to hover over the link to see where it leads to. \n The phishing email below instructed users to click a malicious link in order to participate in a competition called “ETH Giveaway”. Once again, the email was sent from an email address that was not an official Binance email. \n This is a phishing email that pretends to be from listing@binance.com. However, it is not sent from our email server although the domain is legitimate. \n The phishing email below persuaded users to contact a fake Binance staff on Telegram. Then the scammer asked users to deposit crypto into their blockchain addresses. \n All emails can be spoofed. Please be wary even if the email appears to be sent from an official Binance mailer email. Therefore, it is advised to always be on the lookout for emails that sound too good to be true (such as token listings, giveaways, etc.). \n If you think you received suspicious emails that impersonate Binance, please get in contact with Binance Support for further investigation. \n Read more about How to Identify Scammers Impersonating Binance on Telegram or Twitter.

You should always exercise vigilance and educate yourself about general online security. \n Phishing sites would mimic Binance’s domain or website to trick you into sharing your login credentials and personal details. Always check that you’re visiting the official Binance website before logging in. \n Create more complex and secure passwords for your Binance account, and change them periodically. You can use a secure password manager to keep track of your passwords easily.  \n Two-factor Authentication (2FA) protects your Binance and email accounts in case your password is compromised.  \n An anti-phishing code is a security feature that lets you add an extra layer of security to your Binance account. Once youve enabled the anti-phishing code, it will be included in all genuine emails from Binance. This code will allow you to discern real emails from phishing emails, helping you prevent phishing attempts. \n Do not transfer funds to unknown addresses. When you enable the withdrawal address whitelist function, your account can only withdraw to the addresses in the whitelist. \n Enable fingerprint or passcode lock on your devices. Don’t install software from untrusted developers on your devices. If possible, consider using a dedicated device for Binance and trading. In addition, use a secure email provider and enable 2FA for your email account.  \n Always use a wired connection if possible.  \n Never share your personal information or Binance account credentials with anyone.  \n "

Some common examples include: \n The most important and weakest aspect of a security system is people. Tricking you into giving away your money is significantly easier than trying to hack into your Binance account. \n Spoofed messages often contain subtle mistakes such as: \n In addition, attackers may try to push you into action by creating a sense of urgency. For example, an email might threaten that your account will expire, along with its funds, unless you move all assets to a “secure wallet.” This is a scam and the “secure wallet” belongs to the attacker. \n There are various (non-exhaustive) precautions you can take to protect yourself from phishing attacks.  \n 1. Ensure your web browser is updated to the latest version. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox will warn users of phishing or unsafe high-risk websites.  \n 2. Use Binance Verify to cross-check any Binance domains, usernames, and employee names that you encounter. Only use trusted domains. Don’t click or download suspicious links if something seems off.  \n However, please still keep in mind that it’s common for scammers to send emails with a forged sender address. In such cases, even if Binance Verify confirms an email as a “Verified Source,” there’s still a chance that the email contains malicious content (including phishing links).  \n If you’re unsure, you can download the email as an EML file and send it to Binance Support to help review the file to see if it contains malicious content. \n  \n 3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA), such as email, SMS, biometrics, or Binance Authenticator. In the event your username and password is stolen, 2FA acts as an extra layer of protection against a hacker trying to use your compromised credentials.  \n  \n 4. Enable your anti-phishing code. It’s a unique combination of numbers and letters that will appear on every genuine email from Binance. Once enabled, steer clear of emails that don’t have your anti-phishing code. \n  \n 5. Consider installing Chrome Netcraft Extension or Firefox Netcraft Anti-Phishing Extension. \n If you’re unsure of an email, SMS, or website’s legitimacy, contact Binance Support with screenshots and the EML file. The Binance security team will help verify authenticity.  \n EML files provide additional information that can help the Binance security team verify an email’s authenticity.

        "answer": "SMS spoofing is a common cyberattack. Fraudsters use specialized software to manipulate the SMS sender ID, making it as though the message is coming from a legitimate source, such as the bank. In this way, they can steal sensitive information or download malware onto the recipients’ phones.  \n It can be challenging to distinguish between legitimate and spoofed messages. To protect yourself, its crucial to remain vigilant and cautious when responding to unsolicited SMS. Here are some common examples of SMS spoofing: \n The most common type of spoofing is replacing the sender ID with a reputable business’’ number or name. For example, scammers would impersonate Binance or TrustWallet to send phishing SMS. These SMS would be grouped under the same thread as the official messages, like 2FA codes. This is because the hackers used SMS spoofing to manipulate the sender ID and disguise the actual source of the message. \n Scammers would claim that the recipient has won a prize. They would then ask for the recipient’s bank details so they can deposit the winnings or visit a link to claim the prize. \n This involves sending threatening or inappropriate messages to intimidate their victims, hoping to extort money from them. For example, threatening to ban the user’s account. Hackers often take advantage of your fear of losing assets. In this situation, you should remain calm and verify the message before acting. \n For example, here’s a list of suspicious phishing websites impersonating Binance. \n A Binance user received an SMS with the sender name “Binance”, asking them to upgrade their account to continue using Binance service.  \n Hackers used specialized software to manipulate the SMS sender ID, making the fake SMS appear as though it was legitimately coming from Binance. As the fake SMS was under the same thread as the official 2FA code messages, the user assumed that the message was legitimate. After they logged in to the phishing website, their account credentials were stolen by hackers. \n Another Binance user received a fake SMS to confirm a withdrawal. The user thought the message was legitimate and logged in to their account on the phishing website to “cancel the withdrawal request”. \n After obtaining the user’s credentials, the hacker initiated a withdrawal request from their account and guided them to enter the 2FA code on the phishing website. After the user entered the code, the hacker withdrew their assets successfully.  \n Some learning from this example: \n Several Binance users received an SMS with a link to verify or upgrade their accounts, which was a phishing attempt to steal their account credentials.  \n "

They would use these fake Binance profiles to reply to your threads or directly reach out to you through DMs.  \n However, we have no control over the moderation of Twitter. Imposters can easily set up a new account in seconds, even after we’ve flagged them to the platform’s moderation team.  \n Below are some examples we’ve seen on Twitter: \n To safeguard yourself from potential fraud, it’s crucial to keep your personal information secure.

        "answer": "A gift is the promotional reward given to Binance users when they participate in various Binance Gift activities. It contains digital assets of different values. \n You can receive gifts by participating in any promotional activities that include a Binance Gift. Please stay tuned to our announcements for opportunities to participate. \n 1. Log in to the Binance App and navigate to [Account]. Tap [My gifts] to see your available gifts. You can claim new gifts by sharing your referral link or picture with your friends. \n 2. You will receive a random number of tokens as a reward when your first friend successfully registered and completed Identity Verification on Binance. Your friend will also receive a token reward. You can share your gift with a maximum of 5 friends and they will each receive rewards too. However, you will only receive token rewards from the first friend registered via your gift and completed Identity Verification on Binance. \n *New users that register via your gift link will also be counted as your referrals. \n Unfortunately no. Only new registrations completed via your gift referral link are eligible. \n You can use the gifted tokens to trade on Binance Spot, Margin (cross & isolated margin), Futures, Options, or Leveraged Tokens (BLVTs) markets. \n Gifts are withdrawable once you reach the total trading volume requirements specified in the activity before the event ends. The promotional period varies for different activities. \n *Effective trading volume: Spot, Margin (cross & isolated margin), Futures, Options, and Leveraged Tokens (BLVTs), including buys and sells. \n For example, if the requirement for unlocking a gift is “50 USDT trading volume”, it means that you need to complete 50 USDT trading volume on Binance Spot, Margin, Futures, BLVT, or Options after obtaining the gift. Once the total trading volume reaches 50 USDT, the gift will be automatically unlocked and you can withdraw the assets. \n Please note: \n "

        "answer": "1. Here at Binance, we believe that everyone has the right to be heard, understood, and respected. This includes our partners, users, and the Customer Service (CS) agents who take on numerous enquiries each day. The Live Chat is a gateway, designed to assist our users with the various enquiries they have and of course to discuss problems they are experiencing on using the Binance platform and products.   \n 2. Irrespective of the request, our CS agents are happy to take the enquiry and will always treat the enquirers with respect. Our CS agents likewise would expect to be treated with courtesy and respect at all times, and we agree everyone, including our CS agents, has the right to work in a safe environment, free from any abuse or harm caused by others.  \n 3. Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that there is a small percentage of the community who have acted inappropriately by verbally abusing or displaying aggressive behavior towards our CS agents.  \n 4. There will be scenarios from time to time where the enquirers feel as if their requests are not being heard or the outcomes/responses provided by the CS agent are not in line with their expectations. If the enquiriers then use languages with the aim of causing the CS agent to feel threatened, afraid, or abused, those will be considered as abuse or aggressive behavior by us. Such languages may include but are not limited to, threats, unreasonable demands, personal abuse, discriminatory or inflammatory statements, baseless allegations, derogatory remarks, and rudeness. \n 5. To protect our CS agents from such abuse and aggressive behaviors, we have in place a Live Chat Suspension mechanism where the user will be barred from using the Live Chat function.  \n 6. When a user displays abuse and aggressive behavior against our CS agents, the user will be temporarily suspended from contacting our CS agents for a set amount of time. The period of suspension will be determined by Binance as it sees fit.   \n 7. During this time, the suspended user may only chat with the CS bot and is unable to reach our CS agents.   \n 8. We want to ensure that users are not being suspended for the wrong reasons, or where the user genuinely did not abuse or displayed aggressive behavior against our CS agents. If you believe that you are suspended by mistake, such as someone is impersonating you, or if you need immediate assistance for urgent matters, such as your account is hacked, your deposit/withdrawal is missing, etc., please fill in this Appeal Form. We will look into your case as soon as possible.   \n For more information, please visit: \n How to use Live Chat \n "

Please also note that we require the project founder or CEO to fill out the application, as we need to speak to the key person of the project when we encounter any issues with the listing.  \n Please wait patiently after applying as it needs to go through rigorous due diligence. To speed up the process, please be responsive and professional during the evaluation. \n Important notes \n Please note that even though your project might not be listed now, we may reconsider your application in the future when we see improvements from your project.  \n If your project passes our initial review, a member of our team will be in touch. We will only contact you through email. \n Please be sure to only submit the form following the Listing Application links provided on this webpage for direct listing on Binance.com and Launchpad/Launchpool application , and make sure you are not on a phishing site. Always double-check the domain name to protect yourself. \n If you receive a communication purporting to be from Binance, as a first step, you can verify whether a contact you are speaking with is an official representative of Binance here.    \n Warning alert on spoofed or phishing emails! \n There are no set requirements. We want good coins listed on Binance, such as coins with a proven team, a useful product, and a large user base.  \n "

This typically takes a couple of hours, but could take longer if you have a high volume of transactions. Once imported, you’ll be notified via email. \n Once your transactions are imported, you will see all your Binance transactions in the tax tool. You can filter the transactions by category, currency, and date. You may edit or ignore a transaction, or manually add a new transaction. \n 1. Click [Tax Reports] at the top. \n 2. You will see an overview of your tax reports, a summary of your capital gains and income gains, and your transaction history below. Click [Generate] under the type of report you wish to generate. \n Depending on your tax jurisdiction, your Capital Gains and Income Gains report may not include specific tax calculation rules in your country of residence. You’ll also be notified while using Binance Tax if this is the case. You should verify the gains/losses calculations with an independent tax professional prior to filing your taxes. \n 3. Read and agree to the disclaimer and click [Generate]. \n 4. Your request will be processed, and you will be notified once it’s ready.  \n 5. To download your report, click [Export History]. \n 6.

Please note that your taxes may be recalculated after editing a transaction. \n If you don’t want to include a transaction in the tax report calculation, you may ignore it. Please note that your taxes will be recalculated after ignoring a transaction. \n 1. Click [...] next to the transaction and click [Ignore transaction]. \n 2. Click [Confirm] on the pop-up. \n 3. The ignored transaction will be crossed and grayed out. Please note that you cannot edit the ignored transaction. \n If you want to include the transaction again, click [...] - [Include transaction]. \n You may also add transactions conducted outside of Binance to Binance Tax.  \n 1. Click [+ Add Transaction].  \n 2. Select the transaction type (buy, sell, trade, send, convert, transfer, cost, deposit, withdraw). Then, choose the date and time of the transaction and enter the details. You may also add a comment for your own reference. Click [Confirm].  \n 3. You will be notified once the transaction is successfully added. \n 1. What transactions does Binance Tax currently support? \n Currently, Binance Tax supports up to 100,000 transactions on the Binance platform. In the future, you will be able to import transactions from other wallets and blockchains into Binance Tax. \n 2. What is the use of Capital Gains and Income Gains Reports? \n The Capital Gains report summarizes all your trades and transactions on Binance during the reporting year that generate a capital gain or loss, such as converting your crypto to fiat currency. Please note that Binance Tax currently does not support transactions related to certain Binance products, such as Futures and NFTs. You can add these transactions manually or take them up elsewhere on your tax return. \n The Income Gains Report summarizes all transactions during the reporting year that increase your income, such as airdrops, staking, mining, etc. \n 3. How many reports can I generate? \n There is no limit on the number of reports you can generate. Currently, each user can generate a Capital Gain Report, Income Gain Report, or a report of all their transactions in the 2022 tax year. If you decide to edit or manually add a new transaction, you can request a new report anytime, as your tax liability may be recalculated. \n To learn more about crypto tax calculation, check out this Academy article. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "1. Are there any trading fees?",
        "answer": "There are no fees for using Binance Convert. \n In Market mode, live prices are quoted based on the current market conditions. The quoted amount of assets shown is the actual amount of assets you will receive in your account once the conversion is executed. \n In Limit mode, once your order is executed at the specified limit price, the assets will be converted exactly at the specified limit price. \n Binance Convert is a simple tool for you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies without having to place orders on the complex trading interface. You can instantly convert your crypto or fiat assets anytime with a live price based on the current market conditions with zero fees. \n Find out more about the benefits of Binance Convert and how to get started here. \n Binance users who have completed Identity Verification can use Binance Convert. Please log in to your account to access all functionalities, such as checking prices and confirming trades. \n For more information on how to complete Identity Verification, please visit here. \n The minimum and maximum trade amounts will depend on the coin/pair you trade. You can view the limits before entering the trade amount. \n Trades are settled directly into your Spot Wallet or Funding wallet, depending on your selected wallet. Settlement typically occurs immediately or, in some cases, up to a few minutes after confirming a trade. \n Binance Convert is connected to your Binance accounts Spot Wallet and Funding Wallet. Simply deposit and withdraw from your Spot Wallet or Funding Wallet to use Binance Convert. \n To confirm a trade, you must have the assets you sell in your Spot Wallet or Funding Wallet. For example, if you want to buy 10 BTC with USDT and the price per BTC is 10,000 USDT, you must have at least 100,000 USDT in the respective wallet to confirm the trade. \n Market mode allows you to convert your assets at the current market price based on the quoted price in the conversion. \n Limit mode allows you to place an order to convert your assets at a specified limit price. For example, if you place an order to convert USDT to BTC at a limit price of 9,000 USDT and the current BTC price is 10,000 USDT, the order will only execute when the BTC price reaches 9,000 USDT or lower. \n Similarly, if you place an order to convert BTC to USDT at a limit price of 11,000 USDT and the current BTC price is 10,000 USDT, the order will only execute when the BTC price reaches 11,000 USDT or higher. \n Please note that limit-mode order execution is subject to market conditions and may not be completed even if the market price reaches or crosses your limit price momentarily. \n The market price does not include trading fees or factor in the size of your trade. Binance Convert dynamically quotes the best prices (with no hidden fees) based on market conditions. The system will lock the quoted price for a short period for you to review before executing the trade. \n The quoted amount of assets shown during the conversion preview is the actual amount of assets you will receive in your account. There are no additional fees on top of the price quoted. \n After logging in to your account, you can check your history from [Orders] - [Convert History]. \n Binance Convert allows you to swap old versions of tokens for new versions that, for example, may have resulted from project teams implementing a token swap or token migration. The old tokens can only be swapped to the new versions. If a specific old token is not listed, we currently do not support the conversion. \n Please note that there is a daily limit on the amount of old tokens you can convert, which varies by the token. The limit refreshes at 00:00 (UTC+0) every day. \n Yes, Convert trades are included in the spot trading volume calculation, except for old to new token conversions (for tokens that have undergone a token swap or token migration). It will be reflected in the calculation on the day following the trade. \n Binance Convert supports over 350 cryptocurrencies, such as BNB, BTC, and ETH. Please visit here for a complete list of the supported assets. \n Binance Convert supports more than 45,000 conversion possibilities among any two supported tokens through its unique any-coin-to-any-coin feature. However, please note that a few exceptions exist. For example, you can only convert old tokens to new ones, not vice versa. \n When trading on Binance Convert, you are subject to the Binance Terms of Use and the Convert Terms of Use. You may also be subject to the localized versions of these terms if you are onboarded to local Binance entities. Should you have any questions, please contact Customer Service. \n The “NEW” tag refers to newly listed tokens on Binance Convert and will last 7 days after listing. The “HOT” tag refers to the top 3 tokens with the highest percentage gain in price in the last 24 hours. A detailed ranking of tokens can be viewed here. \n "

        "answer_tittle": "Third-Party Platform Fees",
        "answer": "Transaction fees may apply when you trade, deposit, withdraw, create, list, and burn NFTs on Binance NFT. These transaction fees are calculated based on various factors, which include market conditions and network status.  \n You can now buy NFTs from third-party platforms on Binance NFT. Please note that the fees for buying and selling third-party platform NFTs differ from that for NFTs directly listed on the Binance NFT Marketplace.  \n As NFTs from other platforms are on-chain, a gas fee will incur. This means that buyers of third-party-platform NFTs will have to pay the gas fee in addition to the listed price of the NFT asset.  \n Please note that gas prices fluctuate depending on the network traffic. The gas fee you are required to pay will be indicated on the payment confirmation page.  \n When you sell an NFT on Binance NFT, a flat 1% platform service fee on the sale price will incur. This applies to third-party-platform NFTs deposited to and listed for sale on the Binance NFT Marketplace. \n Sellers on Binance NFT are required to pay a royalty fee for each secondary market sale. The royalty fee charged for NFT sales varies by NFT collection and the platform on which the NFT is sold.  \n Please note that the same NFT collection might have different royalty fees on different platforms. You can view the royalty fee on each NFT detail page. \n When you sell an NFT on Binance NFT, a flat 1% platform service fee on the sale price will incur. \n There are no fees for listing NFTs on Binance NFT. \n Every time an NFT is sold, a percentage of the sale price (royalty fees) will be paid to compensate the original NFT creator. Sellers need to pay a royalty fee (0-10%) to the creator, according to the royalty fee the NFT collection creator set. You can view the royalty fee on each NFT detail page. \n For NFTs minted on Binance, the same royalty fee will apply to all NFTs in the collection. Please note that you can only set the royalty fee amount during the NFT creation process. \n For the initial sale of an Unverified NFT (i.e., the first time a newly minted Unverified NFT is sold by the creator to a buyer), creators are restricted from withdrawing the transaction proceeds from the sale for ten days. \n After the Unverified NFT (minted on the Binance NFT Marketplace) has been subject to a 10-day clearing period, and the sold asset does not indicate a potential violation of the Binance NFT Minting Rules and the Terms of Service, the creator will be able to use or withdraw the proceeds. This duration might be adjusted in the future.  \n Learn more in the Binance NFT Sales Settlement Postponement. \n Depositing an NFT to Binance NFT Marketplace will incur a gas fee. This fee is not paid to Binance - it goes to the miners or validators responsible for processing the transactions and securing the respective blockchain network. Please note that gas prices fluctuate according to the network traffic. For more details on how gas fees work, check out this Academy article.  \n To transfer an NFT to other marketplaces, you must first withdraw it from the Binance NFT Marketplace to your wallet. Please make sure you have connected your wallet to Binance. \n Withdrawals to crypto addresses outside of Binance NFT typically incur a transaction fee or network fee. This fee is paid to miners or validators responsible for processing the transactions and securing the respective blockchain network and not to Binance. \n Withdrawal fees on Binance are dynamic and automatically adjusted depending on the network status of the corresponding network (BSC or ETH) in which the NFT asset is kept. \n Note: Withdrawal fees are determined by the blockchain network traffic and can fluctuate without notice due to factors such as network congestion. Please check the actual withdrawal fee you are required to pay on the withdrawal confirmation page.  \n Burning an NFT (to delete it permanently) typically incurs a transaction fee or network fee. This fee is paid to miners or validators responsible for processing the transactions and securing the respective blockchain network and not to Binance. \n Burning fees on Binance are dynamic and automatically adjusted depending on the network status of the corresponding network (BSC or ETH) in which the NFT asset is kept. \n Each NFT is required to pay a minting fee: \n Please note that minting fees can be charged in BNB or ETH. You can check the latest BSC gas prices here and Ethereum gas prices here. \n When creating a new NFT collection, Binance will automatically deploy a smart contract to ETH/BSC for you. You need to provide a wallet address for the smart contract. The person that owns this address can claim ownership and collect royalty fees for the NFT collection on Binance and all NFT marketplaces. Please note that if you do not provide a wallet address, you won’t be able to claim ownership of your collection or collect royalty fees on the DeFi marketplaces.  \n Gas fees are required for deploying smart contracts on the blockchain.  \n Once the collection is created and the smart contract has been deployed, you can change the smart contract owner. However, you will be charged a gas fee as this is an on-chain operation. \n Each NFT collection is required to pay a fixed collection minting fee, which includes a smart contract deployment fee and service fee. The collection minting fee is charged as shown below: \n Ethereum (ETH): 0.50 ETH \n BNB Smart Chain (BSC): 1.00 BNB \n This is to prevent the creation of low-quality NFTs and misuse of this feature and to address feedback received about the NFT minting feature from our community. \n "

        "answer": "NFT Loan is a feature that allows borrowers to use their NFTs as collateral to secure funds from Binance NFT. This overcollateralized, open-term and peer-to-pool loan feature offers distinct Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios for each NFT collateral-loan pair position.  \n The loan amount is based on the value of the NFT and the LTV ratio, which determines the maximum amount of credit issued based on the NFT’s value.  \n Each NFT collateral-loan pair position must be overcollateralized to secure a loan.  This means that the value of the NFT collateral pledged by the borrower must exceed the value of the cryptocurrencies or digital assets advanced by Binance NFT Loan.  \n Binance NFT Loans are open-term. Borrowers can keep their positions open indefinitely, provided that the product supports the loaned and collateral NFT and the relevant LTVs are not exceeded (i.e., the loans are not liquidated). \n Currently, Binance NFT Loan supports 4 NFT collections: Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, and Doodles. More collections will be included in the future. \n For the first phase of the launch, Binance NFT Loan currently only supports Ethereum (ETH) loans. However, there are plans to extend support to other borrowable assets in the future. \n 1. Go to the Binance NFT Loan page.2. Click [Borrow Now].3.

LTV = Loan Value / Collateral Value.Liquidation Threshold: A critical level at which a borrowers collateral value, expressed as a percentage, must surpass to avoid liquidating their assets. For example, the BAYC collateral value must stay above 80% of the loan amount to prevent asset liquidation.

Interest charged will be calculated and added automatically to the outstanding debt on a daily basis at 00:00 (UTC).Any changes to the interest rate will apply to both present and future loan periods. Past loan periods remain unaffected and will be charged according to the interest rate at that time.For example, if you take a loan today (Tuesday) at a 10% interest rate, the daily interest rate will be calculated as (10% * loan amount) / 365 days. If the interest rate changes to 15% tomorrow, the new daily interest rate starting from Wednesday will be (15% * loan amount) / 365 days.2. Interest Calculation using Total Current Debt as Principal:The interest is calculated by considering the total current debt (which includes the principal and any previous interest accrued) as the principal amount.

Initiating Liquidation: Upon a liquidation event, Binance NFT may initiate the process to liquidate the NFT provided as collateral for the loan.3. Valuation of the NFT: The liquidated NFT is appraised based on the floor price when the Dutch Auction starts, which is crucial in conducting the sale to recover the outstanding loan amount. 4. Selling the NFT: The liquidated NFT is up for sale through the Dutch auction process at a fair market price. In a Dutch auction, the price gradually decreases. The Dutch auction starts at 125% of the current floor price, and the price will linearly decrease by 0.5% every 10 minutes, with a resting price of 70%. The Dutch Auction will run for 24 hours.5. Recovering Loan Amount: Once a bid has been accepted, the liquidated NFT is sold to the buyer, and the funds raised from the sale are used to repay the outstanding loan balance.6. Distribution of Proceeds: If the liquidated NFT sells for more than the outstanding interest, principal, and liquidation fee, the net surplus may be returned to the borrower. If the sale proceeds are insufficient to cover the loan, the borrower will not get anything in return, and Binance NFT will bear the bad debt.7. Resolution: The liquidation process is complete after the loan amount and associated fees are fully recovered. 8. Collateral Takeover: If the liquidated NFT fails to be sold off during the 24-hour Dutch auction period, Binance NFT will seize the NFT collateral, taking over ownership and control of the NFT asset.

For further details, see our NFT Terms and Conditions and general Binance Terms of Use and Risk Warning. \n Interest will accumulate continuously during the Dutch auction, until the user fully pays off their loan. Once an NFT has been liquidated, the user must repay the loan amount, interest, and any liquidation fees before getting it back.  \n Even if the floor price rises back up after the NFT has entered into the liquidation process, you are still required to repay your loan as soon as possible. Failure to do so will result in the NFT being sold, and you’ll lose ownership of the collateralized NFT. \n No. Your NFT loan is based on your loan’s Health Factor, and it is not affected by the price of cryptocurrency. It is crucial to carefully monitor and maintain your Health Factor within a secure range to prevent potential liquidations. \n The auction proceeds would first go to Binance NFT to pay off the outstanding debt (borrowed amount, interest accrued, and liquidation fee). The remaining loss will be covered by Binance NFT. \n The liquidated NFT will be transferred to the highest bidder’s account automatically. \n The borrower. The excess will belong to the borrower if the collateral is sold in an auction for greater than the loan amount. \n You can stake your NFTs and get a loan simultaneously on Binance NFT.  \n If you’ve staked your NFT(s) in the Ape Staking Program, click [Borrow Now] on the Staking homepage. \n Alternatively, visit Binance NFT Loan and click [Borrow Now]. \n You can select assets marked as [Staked] to get a loan.  \n If youve obtained a loan with your NFT and wish to stake them in the Ape NFT Staking Program, click [Stake Now] on the NFT Loan homepage or the Binance NFT Ape Staking page. \n If your loan is liquidated, your staked NFT will be unstaked immediately and listed on a Dutch Auction sale. You are advised to repay your loan as soon as possible, or your collateralized NFT could be sold. \n If you repay your loan during liquidation and regain ownership of your NFT, you can re-stake or borrow a new loan with the NFT.  \n Note: You won’t be eligible for any staking reward on the day of liquidation. For example, if your loan is liquidated on 12 June 03:00 UTC, you will not receive your $APE reward for 12 June, and your total $APE daily rewards will only be calculated up until 11 June. \n Before borrowing crypto through an NFT loan, carefully analyze the risks and understand the complete terms and conditions offered by the platform. Only borrow what you can afford to lose, diversify your holdings, and stay well-informed about the market and industry developments to mitigate these risks. \n 1. Collateral price volatility: \n The value of NFTs can be subject to significant fluctuations as the NFT market is still relatively prone to changes in demand or investor sentiment. If the collateral value drops significantly, you may risk liquidation, losing the NFT used as collateral. \n 2. Liquidation risk: \n If the Health Factor of your loan drops below the liquidation threshold set by the platform, your collateral may be liquidated to repay the loan. This may result in the loss of your NFT, and you might receive less than the initial market value for it. \n 3. Interest rate fluctuations: \n The interest rates on crypto loans can change per market conditions or platform policies. If interest rates increase, the cost of servicing a loan might rise, negatively affecting your ability to repay the loan. \n The frequency of topping up your loan balance to maintain the required Health Factor depends on market fluctuations and the performance of your collateral assets.  \n It’s crucial to monitor your loan and collateral closely, especially during periods of high volatility. Should the collateral value decrease, you may need to top up your loan balance more frequently to maintain the required Health Factor and avoid liquidation.  \n If Binance supports the NFT (collections listed on Binance NFT Loan), it will help you claim the airdrop to the best of its ability.

This new subscription mechanism will ensure that all users get an equal opportunity to participate in the Binance NFT primary sales.  \n Binance NFT Subscription Mechanism ensures a fair and square way for BNB and NFT holders to commit tokens towards a Binance NFT sale. The final NFT allocation will be distributed in a fair and square manner.  \n 1. Log in to your Binance account and go to the Binance NFT homepage. Click the banner of an NFT sale you wish to participate in. \n 2. You will be redirected to the subscription page, where you can see a description of the project, the total NFT issued, the Participation Ticket price, the ticket purchase limit per user, and the subscription countdown.  \n There are 4 phases in a Binance NFT Sale. \n 1. Preparation Phase: Fulfill one of the three prerequisites determined by each sale \n Depending on the projects, you have to fulfill one of the three prerequisites to be qualified to subscribe for Participation Tickets in the next phase.  \n You can buy the NFTs specified in the NFT Collection Prerequisites from the Binance NFT Marketplace. All locked NFTs will be automatically returned to your wallet at the end of the Preparation Phase.  \n We will calculate your daily average BNB holdings in that period. Your BNB won’t be locked at this point. If you do not have enough BNB, you can click [Buy More BNB] to buy BNB from the spot market.  \n For example: \n Preparation Phase: 2022-07-15 00:00 (UTC) to 2022-07-17 02:00 (UTC) \n Suppose you have 0.1 BNB in your wallet before 2022-07-15 00:00 (UTC), and you continue to maintain the daily average holding of 0.1 BNB throughout the entire Preparation Phase between 2022-07-15 00:00 (UTC) and 2022-07-17 02:00 (UTC). In this case, you will be eligible to enter the Subscription Phase.  \n Please note that if you top up your wallet balance to meet the minimum daily average BNB holdings after the Preparation Phase begins, you may not be eligible to participate in the Subscription Mechanism sale. \n 2. Subscription Phase: Commit Participation Tickets and the required tokens \n Please note that you must indicate the number of Participation Tickets you would like to commit to the sale during this phase.

For example, based on the price indicated for the value of each NFT under [NFT Collection Prerequisites], you have at least X value of NFT holdings worth of Blue Chip NFTs in your wallet before 2022-07-15 00:00 (UTC). You continue to hold the minimum value required for one ticket based on the Blue Chip NFT worth/per ticket (e.g., 100 USD) throughout the entire Preparation Phase between 2022-07-15 00:00 (UTC) and 2022-07-17 02:00 (UTC). In this case, you will be eligible to enter the Subscription Phase. Blue Chip NFT worth/per ticket: The more Blue Chip NFTs you hold, the more Participation Tickets you can get.

The average value of your NFT holdings will be divided by the value indicated in [Blue Chip NFT worth/per ticket] to calculate the number of Participation Tickets you can receive.NFTs Hard Cap: The maximum number of NFTs you can buy from the Subscription Mechanism Sale.The number of tickets you can receive is calculated as follows: For example, you fulfill the NFT Holding Prerequisite for 3 specified Blue Chip NFT Collections, with 2 NFTs from each collection:(2 * Floor Price of NFT Collection #1) + (2 * Floor Price of NFT Collection #2) + (2 * Floor Price of NFT Collection #3) = X NFT Holding ValueIf the Blue Chip NFT worth/per ticket = 100 USDEach user can get 1 ticket for every 100 USD they hold in the equivalent Blue Chip NFT value based on the floor price at 00:00 (UTC) on the day the Subscription Mechanism sale starts. Number of Participation Tickets you can receive = X NFT Holding Value / Number of Days in the Preparation Phase / 100 USDNumber of Participation Tickets you can receive = 1,000 NFT Holding Value / 5 Days of the Preparation Phase / 23 USD = 8.69Note: All decimal places are rounded down. Therefore, you will receive 8 Participation Tickets. For NFT Holding Prerequisite, different users will receive a different number of Participation Tickets. The Participation Ticket limit will be assigned according to the average Blue Chip NFT holding value calculated during the Preparation Phase.2. Subscription Phase: Commit Participation Tickets and the required tokensPlease note that you must indicate the number of Participation Tickets you would like to commit to the sale during this phase. You can choose to commit some or all of your available Participation Tickets. The more tickets you subscribe, the higher the probability of your tickets getting selected. Please note that this does not guarantee you can successfully purchase an NFT from the sale.For NFT Holding Prerequisite, different users will receive a different number of Participation Tickets. The Participation Tickets limit will be assigned according to the average Blue Chip NFT holding value calculated during the Preparation Phase.You will see the amount of tokens you need to lock up. Click [Subscribe for Ticket(s)].Please note that you can only use the available token balance in your Spot Wallet. Your tokens will be locked up until the Distribution Phase ends.3. Calculation Phase: NFT allocation calculation When the Subscription Phase ends, your subscribed Participation Tickets will enter a pool. The system will select the winners in a fair and square manner. For more details on the winner selection process, please refer to the Binance NFT Subscription Mechanism Winner Selection Algorithm.Please note that there might be a limit on the number of NFTs you can purchase for each Subscription Mechanism sale, as indicated by the [NFTs Hard Cap] on each Subscription Mechanism sale page. If the total number of subscribed participants is less than the total supply of NFTs, there won’t be any hard cap on the number of NFTs you can purchase.If a user is selected to purchase more NFTs than the specified NFTs Hard Cap, the final NFT allocation will be reduced to the hard cap limit;For example, You subscribed to 100 Participation Tickets;The system selected 30 winning Participation Tickets;The NFTs Hard Cap is 20. If the total number of subscribed participants is more than the total supply of NFTs, you can only buy up to 20 NFTs (the Hard Cap).4. Distribution Phase: NFT distribution and token deductionOnce the calculation completes, you will see the allocation details. If your Participation Tickets win, you can use them to purchase the NFT assets in the collection and your locked tokens will be deducted accordingly. If your Participation Tickets do not win, the locked tokens will be returned to your Spot Wallet.  \n You can hold more NFTs from the Blue Chip NFT collections specified in the NFT Collection Prerequisite to increase the value of your average Blue Chip NFT holdings. The value will be calculated based on the floor price of the Blue Chip NFT Collection. \n Please note that the value of your NFT Holdings is calculated daily. If you sell any NFTs after the Preparation Phase begins, the average value of your NFT Holdings might change. \n During the Preparation Phase, Binance NFT will calculate the value of your NFT holdings daily to obtain your average NFT holdings value. Since the Preparation Phase lasts for 3 days, the value of your NFT holdings for the eligible Blue Chip NFT collections will be calculated daily based on the same floor price across three days. Binance NFT will announce the floor price on the Preparation Sale page, and the floor price value used to calculate your holdings won’t change across the Preparation Phase. \n The more Blue Chip NFTs you hold, the higher the value of your average Blue Chip NFT holdings, and the more Participation Tickets you can get in the Subscription Phase.  \n We will calculate the tickets you can get based on your average NFT holdings value.  \n For example, based on the price indicated for the value of each NFT under [NFT Collection Prerequisites], you have at least X value of NFT holdings worth of Blue Chip NFTs in your wallet before 2022-07-15 00:00 (UTC). You continue to hold the minimum value required for one ticket based on the Blue Chip NFT worth/per ticket (e.g., 100 USD) throughout the entire Preparation Phase between 2022-07-15 00:00 (UTC) and 2022-07-17 02:00 (UTC). In this case, you will be eligible to enter the Subscription Phase.  \n Blue Chip NFT worth/per ticket: The more Blue Chip NFTs you hold, the more Participation Tickets you can get. Binance NFT will calculate the value of your NFT holdings every day during the Preparation Phase. The average value of your NFT holdings will be divided by the value indicated in [Blue Chip NFT worth/per ticket] to calculate the number of Participation Tickets you can receive. \n NFTs Hard Cap: The maximum number of NFTs you can buy from the Subscription Mechanism Sale. \n The number of tickets you can receive is calculated as follows:  \n For example, you fulfill the NFT Holding Prerequisite for 3 specified Blue Chip NFT Collections, with 2 NFTs from each collection: \n (2 * Floor Price of NFT Collection #1) + (2 * Floor Price of NFT Collection #2) + (2 * Floor Price of NFT Collection #3) = X NFT Holding Value \n If the Blue Chip NFT worth/per ticket = 100 USD \n Each user can get 1 ticket for every 100 USD they hold in the equivalent Blue Chip NFT value based on the floor price at 00:00 (UTC) on the day the Subscription Mechanism sale starts.  \n Number of Participation Tickets you can receive = X NFT Holding Value / Number of Days in the Preparation Phase / 100 USD \n Number of Participation Tickets you can receive = 1,000 NFT Holding Value / 5 Days of the Preparation Phase / 23 USD = 8.69 \n For NFT Holding Prerequisite, different users will receive a different number of Participation Tickets. The Participation Ticket limit will be assigned according to the average Blue Chip NFT holding value calculated during the Preparation Phase. \n Please note that you must indicate the number of Participation Tickets you would like to commit to the sale during this phase. You can choose to commit some or all of your available Participation Tickets. The more tickets you subscribe, the higher the probability of your tickets getting selected. Please note that this does not guarantee you can successfully purchase an NFT from the sale. \n You will see the amount of tokens you need to lock up. Click [Subscribe for Ticket(s)]. \n When the Subscription Phase ends, your subscribed Participation Tickets will enter a pool. The system will select the winners in a fair and square manner.  \n For more details on the winner selection process, please refer to the Binance NFT Subscription Mechanism Winner Selection Algorithm. \n Please note that there might be a limit on the number of NFTs you can purchase for each Subscription Mechanism sale, as indicated by the [NFTs Hard Cap] on each Subscription Mechanism sale page. If the total number of subscribed participants is less than the total supply of NFTs, there won’t be any hard cap on the number of NFTs you can purchase. \n If a user is selected to purchase more NFTs than the specified NFTs Hard Cap, the final NFT allocation will be reduced to the hard cap limit; \n For example,  \n If the total number of subscribed participants is more than the total supply of NFTs, you can only buy up to 20 NFTs (the Hard Cap). \n Once the calculation completes, you will see the allocation details. If your Participation Tickets win, you can use them to purchase the NFT assets in the collection and your locked tokens will be deducted accordingly. If your Participation Tickets do not win, the locked tokens will be returned to your Spot Wallet.  \n 1. Who can participate in the Binance NFT sale via the Subscription Mechanism? \n All Binance users who have completed the Identity Verification can participate in the Binance NFT primary sale to purchase NFTs.  \n However, to be qualified to subscribe for Participation Tickets in the next phase, you need to meet the prerequisite determined by each sale. There are three different types of prerequisites: \n 2. What are Participation Tickets? \n Participation Tickets give you a chance to purchase NFTs in the sale. You can choose to subscribe some or all of your available Participation Tickets during the Subscription Phase.

Once the calculation completes, you will see the allocation details on the NFT sale page.  \n 5. How many NFTs can I purchase from the NFT sale? \n There is a certain hard cap for each user in each NFT sale. Please refer to the sale page for more details. \n 6. Why do I have to lock NFTs for NFT Prerequisite? \n Introducing NFTs as a new prerequisite brings new use cases to NFTs beyond digital collectibles.

What NFTs do I need to lock? \n Each launch sale requires you to lock NFTs from different collections. Please refer to the NFT Prerequisite on the specific sale page.  \n 8. What will happen to my locked NFTs?  \n Your NFTs are locked for you to be qualified to subscribe for Participation Tickets in the Subscription Phase. They will be returned to your wallet after the Preparation Phase ends. \n 9. Do I stand a higher chance of winning an NFT if I hold more BNB? \n No. Users are only required to meet the minimum daily average BNB holding during the Preparation Phase to be qualified to participate in the corresponding NFT primary sale. All qualified users will proceed to the Subscription Phase, where they will be allocated the same number of Participation Tickets.  \n Only the number of committed tickets will affect the probability. The more tickets a user commits, the higher the chance for the user to buy more NFTs in the sale.  \n "

        "answer": "You can sell your NFTs and Mystery Boxes on the Binance NFT Marketplace using a fixed price, an auction, or accepting a buyer’s offer. As a creator, you’ll also receive a 1-10% royalty payment for any subsequent trading of your NFT on the platform.  \n Whether you are selling an NFT you created or one in your collection, the process is similar and straightforward. The Binance team will review your submission before listing it on the Binance NFT Marketplace. \n After the implementation of the new NFT Asset Exposure feature, all NFT assets on the Binance NFT platform will be discoverable even if they’re not listed for sale. The purpose of this is to increase the exposure of NFT assets to a larger number of users, so they can easily discover more NFTs on the Marketplace. \n The NFT Marketplace filters have also been optimized for asset search. The following new filters are now available on the Marketplace, Collection, and search result pages: \n When you search for a keyword, the system will search for both NFTs and Mystery Boxes, instead of making 2 different searches under each asset type. \n Note: The Rarity filter is only applicable to Mystery Boxes. \n Regardless of whether an NFT or Mystery Box has been listed, it can be searched for and will appear on the search results page, as long as it has been minted on Binance NFT. Please note that all NFTs minted on Binance NFT will be displayed on the creator’s profile page under [Created] and are visible to other users. \n For existing NFTs minted before the minting feature was opened to all verified users, Binance NFT will review them before the NFTs can be found on our marketplace. \n One of the most exciting features for creators on the Binance NFT Marketplace is minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Although other platforms let you create NFTs, Binance is the largest crypto exchange allowing you to quickly mint non-fungible tokens. You can create NFTs on the Binance NFT Marketplace easily. To mint an NFT, you need to create an NFT collection first. Please note that only verified users can create NFTs on Binance, so you must complete Identity Verification before you start.

Select your sell method. Choose from two methods, either Fixed Price [Set Price] or Auction [Highest Bid].  \n 1.1 If you’re using Set Price: \n Select the crypto you’d like to receive and enter the sale price of your NFT. This function also allows buyers to make offers on your NFT.  \n 1.2 If you’re using Highest Bid: \n 1.2.1 Select the crypto you’d like to receive and enter the minimum bid amount for your sale. This is the price at which the bidding will start. For both Fixed Price and Auction, the minimum bid price must be higher than 0.1 BUSD. \n 1.2.2 You may also enter your desired selling price (a buy-out price) under [Auction a Bid] (for NFT sales) or [Buy-out Price] (for Mystery Box sales). Buyers will be able to purchase the item immediately if they offer the buy-out price or when the auction reaches this price.  \n 1.2.3 Select the minimum markup percentage. This limits the buyer’s bid to be 5%, 10%, or 20% higher than the minimum price increase.  \n 2. You can choose to list the NFT immediately after we review your listing. It will be assessed via an automatic verification system. Please note that the review normally takes about 10 minutes. \n Alternatively, select a specific time and date to list. The earliest time you can set is 12 hours after submitting the listing for review. If the review is not completed by your desired listing time, we will list your NFT immediately after approval. \n 3. Set the date and time for your NFT sale. The sale should last for at least 12 hours and no longer than 7 days from the time of listing. \n 4. The category of your NFT will be automatically applied under the same category as the collection. This can help buyers find your NFT more easily. \n 5. Please make sure you read and understand the fees associated with selling your NFT before clicking [Submit]. Every NFT will be assessed via an automatic verification system before it is listed to ensure it meets our standards. This process usually takes 10 minutes. Please wait patiently. You will be notified when your NFT is listed.  \n 6. Once your NFT has been successfully listed, there will be a [Listing Completed] pop-up, as well as the option for you to share the listing on different social media channels, including Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram. \n There are two types of NFT collections on Binance NFT - Verified collection and Unverified collection. NFT collections may be eligible to be listed under the Verified collection depending on various factors, such as sale volume, trading volume, and the number of followers on Binance NFT and other social media platforms. All other NFTs are listed under the Unverified collection. Please refer to the Binance NFT Sales Settlement Postponement Policy for more information.  Please note that it only applies to Unverified collections. \n Currently, you can apply for your Unverified collections to be verified by contacting Customer Service.  Please refer to the FAQ: How to get your NFT Collection Verified on Binance for more information.  \n For an initial sale of an Unverified NFT created and minted on Binance (i.e., the first time a newly minted Unverified NFT is sold by the creator to a buyer), creators will be restricted from withdrawing the transaction proceeds from the sale for 10 days. \n You will see a pop-up with the following message, “This item is part of the Unverified Collection. Therefore, the transaction proceeds from the initial sale of this item will be subject to a 10-day clearing period. See Sales Settlement Postponement Policy for more details.”. \n After the Unverified NFT has been subject to the 10-day clearing period, if the sold asset(s) does not indicate a potential violation of Binance NFT’s Rules and Terms of Service, you will be able to use or withdraw the proceeds. This duration might be adjusted in the future.  \n If any violation has been detected, we may extend the restriction for a further period of time beyond 10 days.

When a buyer makes an offer on your NFT or Mystery Box, you will receive a notification in [Profile]. To check the offer, go to [Profile] - [Offers] and click [Offers Received]. \n Please note that if you receive more than 1 offer for the same item, you will only see the highest offer for each crypto.  \n There is no option to refuse an offer.

        "answer": "To list an NFT / Mystery Box in your collection, go to [Profile] - [Collected]. Click [List NFT] below the asset. \n Alternatively, go to the asset detail page and click [List NFT]. \n 1. Select your sell method. Choose from Fixed Price or Auction. \n 1.1 If you’re using Fixed Price: \n Select the crypto you’d like to receive and enter the selling price of your NFT. This function also allows buyers to make offers on your NFT.  \n 1.2 If you’re using Auction: \n Select the crypto you’d like to receive and enter the [Starting Price] (minimum bid amount). This is the price at which the bidding will start. \n You may also enter your desired selling price (buyout price) under [Buyout Price]. Buyers will be able to purchase the item immediately if they offer the buyout price or when the auction reaches this price.  \n Then, select the minimum markup percentage. This limits the buyer’s bid to be 5%, 10%, or 20% higher than the minimum price increase.  \n 2. You can choose to list the NFT immediately after we review your listing. It will be assessed via an automatic verification system. Please note that the review normally takes about 10 minutes. \n Alternatively, select a specific time and date to list. The earliest time you can set is 12 hours after submitting the listing for review. If the review is not completed by your desired listing time, we will list your NFT immediately after approval. \n 3. Set the date and time for your NFT sale. The sale should last for at least 12 hours and no longer than 30 days from the time of listing. \n 4. The category of your NFT will be automatically applied under the same category as the collection. This can help buyers find your NFT more easily. \n 1. Please make sure you read and understand the fees associated with selling your NFT before clicking [Submit]. Every NFT will be assessed via an automatic verification system before it is listed to ensure it meets our standards. This process usually takes 10 minutes. Please wait patiently. You will be notified when your NFT is listed.  \n 2. Once your NFT has been successfully listed, there will be a [Listing Completed] pop-up, as well as the option for you to share the listing on different social media channels, including Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram. \n If your NFTs / Mystery Boxes haven’t been listed before, they will be subject to a 10-day clearing period. \n 3. To view your listed NFTs or Mystery Boxes, go to [Profile] - [My NFTs] - [Listings]. \n Important Note: \n There are two types of NFT collections on Binance NFT - Verified collection and Unverified collection. NFT collections may be eligible to be listed under the Verified collection depending on various factors, such as sale volume, trading volume, and the number of followers on Binance NFT and other social media platforms. All other NFTs are listed under the Unverified collection. Please refer to the Binance NFT Sales Settlement Postponement Policy for more information. Please note that it only applies to Unverified collections. \n Currently, you can apply for your Unverified collections to be verified by contacting Customer Service. Please refer to How to get your NFT Collection Verified on Binance for more information.  \n For the initial sale of an Unverified NFT created and minted on Binance (i.e., the first time a newly minted Unverified NFT is sold by the creator to a buyer), creators will be restricted from withdrawing the transaction proceeds from the sale for 10 days. \n You will see a pop-up with the following message, “This item is part of the Unverified Collection. Therefore, the transaction proceeds from the initial sale of this item will be subject to a 10-day clearing period. See Sales Settlement Postponement Policy for more details.”. \n After the Unverified NFT has been subject to the 10-day clearing period, if the sold asset does not indicate a potential violation of Binance NFT’s Rules and Terms of Service, you will be able to use or withdraw the proceeds. This duration might be adjusted in the future.  \n If any violation has been detected, we may extend the restriction for a further period beyond 10 days. Learn more about the Binance NFT Sales Settlement Postponement Policy for Unverified NFT Collections here. \n You can list and delist your NFTs on other NFT marketplaces directly from the Binance NFT Marketplace using the new Aggregated Listing feature. \n Note: You can only use the Aggregated Listing feature with the top NFT collections on the Ranking page under the [Top Collections] tab. More NFT collections will continue to be integrated with the aggregated listing feature regularly. \n You can only set up Aggregator NFT listings as fixed-price NFTs. When listing an NFT from Binance NFT, there are two options. You can list the NFT on the Binance NFT or on Binance NFT Marketplace and Aggregator marketplaces. Either way, your NFT must be listed on the Binance NFT Marketplace. \n You must pay a gas fee when you set up an Aggregator NFT listing. Binance NFT has to transfer your NFT to its DeFi wallet to list the NFT on Aggregator platforms. As this process occurs on the blockchain, it will incur a gas fee. For example, listing NFTs on OpenSea does not incur a listing fee, but you must pay a gas fee. You may also need to pay a platform fee if the NFT is successfully sold on OpenSea. \n To learn more about listing NFTs, please refer to How to List NFTs in Bulk on Binance NFT Marketplace. \n Go to [Profile] - [Collected]. Click [List NFT] on the NFT asset card. \n 2. Select [Fixed Price]. Choose the crypto you’d like to receive and enter the selling price of your NFT.  \n However, if you decide to list the NFT on an Aggregator NFT marketplace, you won’t be able to select a starting time, and the duration feature will be grayed out. It will be listed immediately.  \n Note: \n You’ll see a confirmation pop-up with the gas fee. To list the NFT on an Aggregator platform, a gas fee will incur. It has to be paid in advance so the system can process the Aggregator NFT listing on the blockchain. Please note that you won’t receive a refund for the gas fee if the listing fails. Click [Confirm] to proceed. \n Next, you will see a [Listing in Progress] pop-up window. Please wait patiently, you’ll receive an email notification when the listing process is complete. \n  \n Once the listing process is complete, you’ll see [Listing Successful]. \n  \n If you’re listing more than 1 NFT and only some of them have been listed, you’ll see the number of successfully listed NFTs in the pop-up. To view the listed assets, click [View Profile] and go to [Profile] - [Listings]. \n Please note that the selected NFT(s) will be frozen during the listing process and cannot be traded or withdrawn. If you do not see the [Listing Successful] pop-up after 10 minutes, the listing might have failed and the NFT(s) will be returned to your Binance account. You won’t receive a refund for the gas fee. \n If the listing fails, you will see a [Listing Failed] notification pop-up. Youll receive an email detailing the reason for the error. If youre listing the NFT on multiple marketplaces and one of them fails to list, the listing process is considered unsuccessful. Please try again later. \n If only the Aggregator NFT listing is unsuccessful, click [Retry] to re-initiate the request. Please note that if the listing fails three times, you have to set up the listing from step 1 again. \n  \n  \n 1. When do I need to complete Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)? \n If the Binance risk management policies are triggered, you may be asked to enter your Pay PIN or complete Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to confirm the action. \n 2. Why do I need to pay a gas fee to set up an Aggregator NFT listing?  \n When you list an Aggregator NFT, Binance NFT has to transfer your NFTs to Binance NFTs DeFi Wallet first and then list it on an Aggregator platform. As this process is performed on the blockchain, you have to pay a gas fee.  \n Please note that listing NFTs on OpenSea does not incur a listing fee. You only need to pay for the gas, royalty, and platform fees if the NFT is successfully sold on OpenSea. \n "

Select the wallet you want to connect. Currently, we support MetaMask and WalletConnect. For more information, please check our wallet guides here: \n Let’s use MetaMask as an example. Please note that you need to install the MetaMask extension in your Chrome browser before initiating the deposit process.  \n If you haven’t installed the MetaMask extension, click [Install MetaMask]. \n 4. Once verified, your wallet is now connected.  \n If you see an error message “Wallet connection failed, please retry.”, you can repeat the steps above to reconnect your wallet. \n Once you have successfully connected your wallet, please follow Step 2.1 to select and deposit your NFTs/NFT collections. If your wallet cannot connect properly, you will be redirected to manually search for the NFT contract address and Token ID. Please refer to Step 2.2. \n 1.

You can use the search function to search for specific NFT collections. \n If there are no NFTs from the whitelisted collection in your connected wallet, you will see an empty screen.

Paste the contract address or enter the name of the NFT collection to search. \n Please note that your NFT contract address needs to be pre-approved before you can import the NFT to the Binance NFT Marketplace. You may check the supported whitelisted contract addresses from NFT Deposits - Approved Contract Addresses, which are NFT collections from third-party platforms. NFT collections/NFTs minted and created on Binance can be deposited onto Binance as well.  \n 2. Select the Token ID(s) of the NFT(s) you would like to deposit and click [Select TokenID]. You can select more than one Token ID from the same contract address to deposit.  \n 3. You can click [Total NFT Selected] to view all the NFTs you selected. You may add or remove the NFTs to be deposited.  \n 4. If you cannot locate the NFT you want from the list, enter the Token ID manually in the search box. If the system cannot find or does not support the Token ID you searched for, you will see “No match found.”. Please check the Token ID you entered, switch to another network, or connect a new wallet. \n Please note that even if you can’t see the image and title of the NFT, it can still be deposited to Binance if the Token ID you entered is valid.

Your crypto wallet is not connected correctly \n To fix this issue, reconnect your wallet to Binance. If you have more than one crypto wallet, make sure youre connected to the correct wallet and network. \n 2. Your NFT collection’s contract address is not supported on Binance NFT \n The NFT deposit feature only accepts NFT contract addresses that have been fully integrated with the Binance NFT Marketplace. For a complete list of the supported NFTs and third-party NFTs, please refer to: \n 3. Your NFT is no longer in your DEX wallet \n If the NFT you are trying to deposit on Binance NFT is listed on an external DEX platform and it was sold during the deposit process, the deposit will fail as you no longer own the NFT in your wallet. Please check and ensure the NFT is still in your wallet before attempting to deposit it to Binance NFT again.  \n 4.
